# what kinds of custom PC setups are covered in your book?

## standard thick client

# step 1: keeping in mind the hardware specifications of your Raspberry Pi and your experience with the machine, consider how well the Pi could do in terms of these seven custom PC setups (keep extension capabilities in mind)

---

class: center, middle

# step 2: identify three custom PC setups: one the Pi would do best at (relatively speaking), one the Pi would do okay at, and one that the Pi would do terrible at

# step 3: list these three types, describe how well you think the Pi would do at each, and explain your reasoning

---

class: center, middle

# step 4: pick the setup type you think it would do best at; tell me what additional hardware you would buy and any additional steps you would take when building this setup (always explain why)

# "I found Beres' point of Ipads being shipped if laid flat, would be as tall as 862 Empire State buildings the most interesting. I think that the number of resources to make Ipads for not only the U.S. but for other countries that have introduced Apple products into their society is enormous. And with new Ipads and Iphones coming out each year, where are the old ones going?"

# "I believe the most important topic [he] covers is the fact that we should be able to interchange hardware parts in phones, tv's, laptops etc. I agree with this and it would help to eliminate e-waste and be better for the environment, because if we could interchange parts to make our devices better, less people would actually need to buy another physical device."

# "This year, the French government began requiring tech manufacturers to list an “indice de réparabilité,” a repairability score, on product pages for items like the iPhone and MacBook. If a device can be repaired, then its life can be extended, saving consumers money and the planet the burden of so many trashed gadgets."

# "I believe the reparability score is the most important. I used to work at a computer store, and many companies make it extremely difficult to repair their devices, or you can't at all, just so you have to go through them to fix it."

## "The PinePhone Pro is held together by standard Phillips screws –  all you need to repair it is a suitable screwdriver and some spare time."

# "Manufacturers don’t talk much about this turnover when they announce the big new thing that will replace your mostly just as good old thing. This is all by design. There’s a term for it: planned obsolescence, or designing a product with an intentionally limited life span."

# "I think that the most important point that was made in this was that the devices that are most of time just thrown are still very usable and could be used with out upgrading to the newest and best device out on the market."

# "Each year new device are released, most of the changes are performance, power or physical appearances. Even if the changes are small, Apple in specific will release it as a brand new device. This is especially evident with the iPhone 12 & 13, two phones that look almost identical but with minor or subtle changes."

# "In 2016 and 2017, consumers using both the regular and Plus versions of iPhone 6, 6S, SE, and 7 devices complained that their phones became significantly slower over time. User testing discovered that the iPhone was apparently throttling performance intentionally to preserve battery life..."

# "Apple confirmed in December 2017 that newer versions of iOS were indeed intentionally reducing performance on those devices to prevent taxing the batteries. The company offered owners of those phones reduced-price battery replacements—$29, instead of $79—throughout 2018 in order to alleviate the issue."

# "The pandemic has made the tech giants and their bosses unfathomably rich. (Even more unfathomably rich than they were before.) Apple has so much extra cash that it’s spending an additional $90 billion to buy its own stock, nearly the equivalent of Kenya’s gross domestic product."
