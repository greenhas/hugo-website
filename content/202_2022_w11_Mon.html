# patch management in Windows 10

--

* "individual users can't turn off updates" (Meyers, 2019, p. 581)

--

* *quality updates*: smaller, cumulative patches

--

* *feature updates*: new versions of Windows, named by year and month up through `2004`

--

    * "Windows 10, version 20H2 is, therefore, '20H2' because it will be released in the second half of the 2020 calendar year" ([Windows Experience blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/06/16/whats-next-for-windows-10-updates/))

--

* Windows 10 is only the tip of the iceberg!

---

# patch management on other operating systems

--

* macOS: through the *App Store* and *Software Update* interfaces

--

* Linux distros: it depends, but a GUI updating tool is usually available
