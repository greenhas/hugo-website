# why learn the command-line interface?

---

class: center, middle

# "First, if you know what you're doing, you can do most jobs more quickly by typing a text command than by clicking through a graphical user interface (GUI)."

(Meyers, 2019, p. 627)

---

class: center, middle

# "Second, a *command-line interface (CLI)* doesn't take much operating system firepower, so it's the nautral choice for jobs where you don't need or don't want a full-blown GUI for an OS."

(Meyers, 2019, p. 627)

---

class: center, middle

# "Third, text commands are easily added to scripts, enabling you to perform complex tasks automatically." 

(Meyers, 2019, p. 627)

---

class: center, middle

# "A *script* is a small program used to help automate computing tasks." 

(Meyers, 2019, p. 672)

---

class: center, middle

## "Most of the time all you need tis to enter one or two commands, but sometimes you will find yourself repeating the same series of commands over and over. When you find yourself in this situation, it might be a good idea to write a *script* to run that series of commands."

(Meyers, 2019, p. 672)
