> *Some CMSs are like printed newspapers.... Other CMSs are like town hall meetings....*

--

* user-generated content is cheaper to produce than 

--

> *individuals' use of social media creates value that can be appropriated by other parties for profit generation (Bodle 2016)*

Neil Selwyn, *What is digital sociology?*, p. 54

--

* how could user-generated content create value for your hypothetical organizations?

# content and community

--

> *Some CMSs are like printed newspapers.... Other CMSs are like town hall meetings....*

Deane Barker, *Web Content Management: Systems, Features, and Best Practices*, p. 30

--

> *individuals who collectively write about their lives in their own space and reciprocally comment on posts written on other, topically similar blogs*

Vanessa Dennen, *Constructing academic alter-egos: identity issues in a blog-based community*, p. 25

--

> *One might liken the role of individual blogs and bloggers to the blogging community to how individual people and their houses form neighborhood communities when they interact with each other, replacing the connection via physical proximity with one based on topical proximity.*

# downsides of UGC

---

# some users act in bad faith

--

> *Social media platforms put more people in direct contact with one another.... Though the benefits of this may be obvious... the perils are also painfully apparent, more so every day: the pornographic, the obscene, the violent, the illegal, the abusive, and the hateful.*

Tarleton Gillespie, *Custodians of the internet*, p. 5

--

> *Websites which have been repeatedly subjected to these activities include: The Daily Mail; Daily Express and The Times in the UK; America’s Fox News and Washington Post; Le Figaro in France; Der Spiegel and Die Welt in Germany; and Italy’s La Stampa.*

Cardiff University, *High-profile Western media outlets repeatedly infiltrated by pro-Kremlin trolls*

--

> *if there's a link from our site to your site, then that will help you move up the Google indices... I have people, like, selling beauty products and those kinds of things who will come on and just create content... and the only purpose for it is to link to their website... it's easy to go in and just delete that kind of stuff, but we need to create a better system*

Dr. Royce Kimmons, creator of EdTechBooks.org

# content moderation is a hard job

--

> *There is no platform that does not impose rules, to some degree. Not to do so would simply be untenable.*

Tarleton Gillespie, *Custodians of the internet*, p. 5

--

> *The dispute between Facebook moderators and breastfeeding mothers has lasted more than a decade.*

Tarleton Gillespie, *Custodians of the internet*, p. 143

--

> *OnlyFans hosts over two million creators, some of whom share nude and pornographic content. Now, the Vienna Tourist Board is one of them.*

Joe Hernandez, *Vienna museums' social media posts got rejected for nudity, so they're on OnlyFans*

--

> *there’s a long history of non-sexual content—and particularly, LGBTQ+ content—being classified by machine learning algorithms (as well as human moderators) as “sexually explicit.”*

Jillian York, *How LGBTQ+ content is censored under the guise of sexually explicit*

---

# content moderation is a terrible job

--

> *AI does play a role in moderating content on Facebook, but as an anonymous content moderator told us, it mainly deals with benign posts. Human moderators are the ones tasked with sifting through the more disturbing content.*

Emma Roth, *Facebook content moderators protest low wages with mobile billboard*

--

> *The video depicts a man being murdered. Someone is stabbing him, dozens of times, while he screams and begs for his life. Chloe’s job is to tell the room whether this post should be removed. She knows that section 13 of the Facebook community standards prohibits videos that depict the murder of one or more people. When Chloe explains this to the class, she hears her voice shaking....*

--

> *No one tries to comfort her. This is the job she was hired to do. And for the 1,000 people like Chloe moderating content for Facebook at the Phoenix site, and for 15,000 content reviewers around the world, today is just another day at the office.*

Casey Newton, *The trauma floor: The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America*

> *Facebook’s senior executives interfered to allow US politicians and celebrities to post whatever they wanted on its social network despite pleas from employees to stop, leaked internal documents suggest.*
