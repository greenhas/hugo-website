# My Origin Story

I grew up (mostly) in [Florence, Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence,_Kentucky) and attended [Boone County High School](https://www.boone.k12.ky.us/1/Home), where I participated in [speech and debate](https://khssl.org/), competed in the Kentucky [Governor's Cup](https://www.kaac.com/governors-cup), developed a lifelong love for the French language, and played a **lot** of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. 

I took my diverse interests (and extreme nerdery) with me to [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/), in Provo, Utah. I took two years off after my freshman year to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in western France and Francophone Switzerland, returning with a deepened passion for the French language and a new appreciation for the different countries and cultures of the world. Upon my return to BYU, this involved keeping up my French and flirting with disciplines such as international relations, Middle Eastern studies, and computer science. However, after taking a class from [Dr. David Wiley](https://davidwiley.org/), I decided on a future studying educational technology and managed to fit all of these interests into a major in French Teaching and a minor in Political Science Teaching. 

After a brief stint as a French, debate, and keyboarding teacher in Utah, I entered the [Educational Psychology and Educational Technology](http://education.msu.edu/cepse/ed-tech/) PhD program at Michigan State University. I began with (and still have!) an interest in educational and meaningful games, and eventually earned a graduate certificate in [Serious Game Design & Research](https://reg.msu.edu/AcademicPrograms/ProgramDetail.aspx?Program=1497) from MSU's College of Communication Arts and Sciences. Some of my early research efforts in this area involved working with an [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) for a board gaming website, which sparked an interest in collecting and analyzing data generated by digital communities and eventually evolved into a focus on Twitter research. Working with [Digital Humanities](http://digitalhumanities.msu.edu/) researchers at MSU helped me develop my familiarity with digital research methods, contributed to my focus on **meaning** in data (rather than just data themselves), and resulted in another [graduate certificate](http://digitalhumanities.msu.edu/graduate-certificate/). In June 2018, I successfully defended my dissertation, which compared around 60 Twitter hashtags used by teachers in different American states and Canadian provinces. 

Two months later, I began my appointment at the University of Kentucky's [School of Information Science](http://ci.uky.edu/sis/), which both completes the circle and provides exciting new
