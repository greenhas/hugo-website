# what is content?

---
# two defining characteristics of content

According to [Barker](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/content/), content is information that is:

--

* created by editorial process, and

--

* intended for consumption by a human audience

# let's look at these in more detail

# what is an editorial process?

--

> *the process someone goes through when creating content, everything from ideation to preparation to actual creation to evaluation to finally publication*

--

> *The editorial process could be the revisions someone would do from the first draft to the final draft. It's done to improve the quality of the work and catch any mistakes that may be within it.*

# the human factor

--

> *I think an editorial process refers to the series of decisions that people make around what information they present and how they present it. The element of human decision making and intention feels like an important part of defining content.*

> *I think the auto-correct feature on our smartphones is part of the editorial process as it proof reads what we write*

# how does technology fit in with the editorial process?

Horgan, C. (2021, August 29). We used to write: How to keep writing human in a world of A.I. tools. *OneZero*. https://onezero.medium.com/we-used-to-write-bfed4d4eefca

> *Worries about how technology affects writing — that is to say, handwriting — are older than personal computers and word processors. In a short 1938 editorial, the New York Times briefly contemplated the history of the lead pencil, concluding that “writing with one’s own hand seems to be disappearing, and the universal typewriter may swallow all.” As far as they typewriter’s QWERTY keyboard is concerned, this proved to be an accurate prediction. That arrangement of keys remains the standard for desktop, laptop, and mobile keyboards.*

> *“Apps like these aim to bring our text in line with an algorithmic norm,” Crystal Chokshi [wrote](https://reallifemag.com/recommended-writing/) at RealLife in January. “They define ‘good’ writing as efficient writing; and according to their marketing campaigns, writing can be efficient because its hallmarks are pattern and repetition.” Computer-generated writing, in other words, assumes Heidegger’s fear as foundational: that everyone’s writing should look the same.*

> *Computer-assisted writing tools in the form of things like spell check or auto-correct have been standard for years, available to anyone using a word processing program like Microsoft’s Word, Apple’s Pages, or Google Docs. Lately, those companies have expanded their offerings to their email services, scanning text and offering up pre-composed responses to messages. When Google’s Gmail hit 15, the company noted the apparent popularity of its artificial writing assistant, SmartCompose. “It’s already saved people from typing over 1 billion characters each week — that’s enough to fill the pages of 1,000 copies of ‘Lord of the Rings,’ Google boasted.*

# back-end and front-end content concerns

this class is not just technical!

--

> *Content strategists come in two main types: front-end and back-end. If you’re a marketer who treats your organization’s content as a business asset, you need to understand both types of strategist so you can bring in the right kind of help at the right time or develop the appropriate skills in-house.*

[Rockley (2016)](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2016/02/types-content-strategist/)

--

> *the "front-end" deals with the creative side of content, such as ideas for creating/designing content and where that content is presented and to what audience it is presented...  the "back-end" ... deals with the technical side of content, such as the editing, storing, and organizing of content*

Where do you feel your talents lie?

--

This class is mostly about back-end technical aspects, but it's impossible to practice that without also considering front-end organizational/personal aspects.

# working together

--

more about this in Module 4!

--

> *If both roles don't coordinate then perhaps the goals of the front-end won't be met, or the back-end may not have a full understanding of what needs to be done.*

# content management as a restaurant

--

> *Front-end and Back-end are just like a restaurant where the front-end is the front of house that take cares of the dinners and the orders whereas the back-end or the chefs do exactly what they have to do to feed the dinners. If any of them do not coordinate they will be left with hungry and unhappy dinners. I hope that made sense.*
