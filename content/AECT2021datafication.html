At some point in human evolution, our ancestors learned that sugary foods like fruit have more calories than other foods but that they were relatively rare and should therefore be eaten whenever possible. As a result, I was born with an evolutionary instinct to prefer sugary foods.

As useful as this instinct may have been for earlier generations of humans, I live in a world where sugar is easy to come by, and I have difficulty separating that instinctive desire to eat sugar from the cold, hard fact that not all sugary foods are as good for me as fruit was for my evolutionary ancestors. Rest assured, though, that I am not taking an anti-chocolate position in this presentation, and I'm not trying to make simplistic comments about diet that can do more harm than good. My point here is to set up an imperfect analogy to make another point.

As educational researchers, we are necessarily scientists, and as such, we embrace particular philosophical commitments, including a commitment to empiricism. We want evidence, we want data to support our conclusions. This is a good commitment to have for our professional work. We can't do our jobs without empirical evidence—we can't do our jobs without data.

However, unlike previous generations of educational researchers, we live in a data-rich world, and that can complicate our instinctive, generally-good appetites for data. Like my comparison of apples to chocolate, I don't want to oversimplify this issue. Living in a data-rich world offers some tremendous new opportunities for the AECT community and other education researchers.

Generally speaking, I agree with all of these statements. Thumbs up! Having written frequently—and often effusively—about the potential of our data-rich world for education research, I don't want to cast doubt on the entire enterprise. However, I do want to talk today about how our instinctive appetite for data as researchers can lead us astray as we pursue some of these new avenues.

# some good data is necessary
# vs. 
# all data is necessarily good

???

In particular, I want to distinguish the undeniable truth that "some good data is necessary" from the mistaken thinking that "therefore, all data is necessarily good."

# data are not objective but are value-laden

???

Again, this does not mean that data, or big data, or digital data are inherently bad; rather, it is important to consider that data of any kind are value-laden.

Let's take a relatively straightforward example to start with. Over the past 18 months, many students have had their first encounters with online proctoring services.

# "Proctorio, which operates as a browser plug-in, can detect whether your gaze is pointed at the camera; it tracks how often you look away from the screen, how much you type, and how often you move the mouse."

Caplan-Bricker, N. (2021, May 27). Is online test-monitoring here to stay? *The New Yorker* [https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/is-online-test-monitoring-here-to-stay](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/is-online-test-monitoring-here-to-stay)

# "Meanwhile, Proctorio is also monitoring the room around you for unauthorized faces or forbidden materials."

# "At the end of the exam, the professor receives a report on each student’s over-all 'suspicion score,' along with a list of moments, marked for an instructor to review, when the software judged that cheating might have occurred." 

Caplan-Bricker, N. (2021, May 27). Is online test-monitoring here to stay? *The New Yorker* [https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/is-online-test-monitoring-here-to-stay](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/is-online-test-monitoring-here-to-stay)

???

Even the most research-savvy of professors is going to face a temptation to interpret that "suspicion score" as hard, objective data; data that we wouldn't have without services like Proctorio; and therefore surely beneficial and helpful. However, there is no such thing as hard, objective data.

# "The choice for a “like” button betrays an ideological predilection: it favors instant, gut-fired, emotional, positive evaluations. Popularity as a coded concept thus not only becomes quantifiable but also manipulable: boosting popularity rankings is an important mechanism built into these buttons."
