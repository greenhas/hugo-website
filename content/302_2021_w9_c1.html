# content aggregation

--

> *An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/aggregation/)

--

can you think of content aggregation examples in the content that you consume?

# content shape

---

# content aggregation matters!

--

> *I often find that I also get confused and overwhelmed when a podcast has a lot of content and no organization. I think itâ€™s great that they have a website that allows them to keep the content more organized and to help their listeners find the podcast they need!*

Mollie Nave

--

> *Logical navigation, navigation that supports multiple entry points, navigation that supports multiple pathways to content, search bar and its algorithm, and tags are also key points in Information Architecture and yet they were talking about them from a content management point. We want to manage content in a way that increases user usability and findability of content, which is the basic principle of IA.*

# WordPress features that support content aggregation

--

* menus

--

* categories

--

* tags

--

* widgets

--

* search

---

# serial

--

* organized "in a line"

--

---

# hierarchical

--

* organized like a family tree, with "parent" and "child" content

--

* menus and categories are especially helpful here

# tabular

--
    
* organized in a table or database and then accessed through searching

> *Based on what I have learned about this website I feel like it is more like a Database and when I think of databases the first thing that comes to my mind is an advanced search option where one can use boolean or the authors name or even use specific terms to find podcasts.*

# network

--

* organized through links between content

--

* tags are _kind of_ related to network content

# relational: 

--

* similar to hierarchical, but different content types and different relationships are more tightly defined

# implicit vs. explicit aggregation

--

* implicit aggregation is built off of the attributes _internal_ to the content itself

--

* explicit aggregation is defined _externally_ to the content itself

--

* [302 sandbox site](https://sised.is.uky.edu/ict302wp/)

--

* [Project Zion Episodes Quick List](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/episodes-quick-list/)

--

> *Manually defining your menu comes with advantages of designing your menu to complement and bolster the content and it can be designed for preferred navigation methods. However, this adds on to the work someone already has to do in order to implement the specific menu.*

# static vs. dynamic aggregation

--

* static aggregation is hand-picked and arbitrary

--

* dynamic aggregation is automatically-generated based on criteria

--

* [Project Zion series](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/category/steamers-and-sodas/)

---

# fixed vs. variable aggregation

--

* both of these derive from dynamic aggregations

--

* a fixed aggregation is the same every time for everyone

--

* a variable aggregation changes based on context

--

> *What confuses me is that what is the difference between advanced search and tags?*
