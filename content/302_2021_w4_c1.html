# what is content management?

# content management

--

> *A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/content-management/)

--

> *After a horrible rough cut of the film, the editors were able to delete, reorder, and change scenes along with adding voiceover and reusing some footage to add the correct amount of exposition, action, and suspense.*

# content management

--

> *There simply is no single skill of “cooking.” If you say, “I can cook!” what are you saying? It’s not like you stand there and then just…cook. It’s not binary like you’re just “cooking” or “not cooking.”*

Deane Barker, ["Content Management is an Emergent Skill"](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/content-management-is-emergent-skill/)

--

> *Breaking down a more abstract idea like being good at "cooking" into the individual skills that compose it could be useful in picking what aspect of the emergent skill you want to improve or work on.*

Quinn Troia

--

> *Front-end and Back-end are just like a restaurant where the front-end is the front of house that take cares of the dinners and the orders whereas the back-end or the chefs do exactly what they have to do to feed the dinners. If any of them do not coordinate they will be left with hungry and unhappy dinners. I hope that made sense.*

# roles in content management

--

> *Despite the assumed significance of certain roles, all roles in a movie are vital to its success. This is seen in Stars Wars, where the editors and their edits completely revamped and saved the movie. However, this is also seen through the music composer and the visual effects designer, who elevated the movie tremendously.*

Allison Turner

--

> *This is not always thought of when including content because many people are focused on what they are seeing but not the work that it took to make sure that their content reached the appropriate audience.*

# roles in content management

--
five roles in Barker's *Web Content Management*:
* editors
* site planners
* developers 
* administrators
* stakeholders

--

# 🎩🧢👒🎓

---

# editors

--

> *A CMS user responsible for performing editorial process to create, edit, or otherwise manage content. An editor creates, manages, edits, approves, and publishes content. This is considered the core user of a CMS. Most CMS functionality is based around editors.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/editor/)

--

### subtypes:

* power editor
* approver
* community manager / content moderator
* marketer

---

# site planners

--

> *Site planners are responsible for designing the website the CMS will manage. Most of their involvement will be prior to launch, with sporadic further involvement as the site develops and changes over time.* 

Deane Barker, *Web Content Management: Systems, Features, and Best Practices*, p. 56

---

# developers

--

> *The role responsible for installing, configuring, extending, and templating a CMS implementation.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/developer/)

--

### subtypes:

* front-end developers (work with HTML/CSS and templates)
* back-end developers (work with the CMS itself and extensions)

---

# administrator

--

> *A role responsible for managing the settings, users, permissions, and other configurable functionality of a CMS. This role manages the system itself, not the content within it.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/administrator/)

--

> *The person in the administrator role is often also a power editor, and occasionally one of the implementing developers.*

---

# stakeholder

--

> *A role which does not interact directly with the CMS but is primarily concerned with the results the CMS is intended to bring about.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/stakeholder/)

---
# workflow

--

> *An framework to move content through a defined set or map of specific steps, activities, or tasks.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/workflow/)

--

> *The content can only be “in” one such state for a particular workflow at a time. When that state resolves, content will “move” to another state, and continue until the workflow ends.*

# importance of workflow

--

> *I think the biggest factor with all of these things is communication. Everyone has to be on the same page so that the content is what everyone had in mind and successful for the company. If anyone is confused by what is going on; like the writer thinking there is a different message than what the company employees think, then things can go bad. Everyone must constantly be communicating in order to properly deliver the content.*

Conner Goldsmith

--

> *It reminds me of a game of telephone. For example, if marketing doesn’t articulate what goals need to be achieved in terms that the point-of-contact can understand, then the point-of-contact doesn’t have a very accurate picture of what the content needs to look like for the contracted project manager, then the project manager communicates that ill-informed idea to his or hers writers, and finally, it is impossible for the writers to deliver what the company needs in term of content.*

McKensie Millay

# when workflow goes wrong!

--

> *For a brief moment this week, startled readers of a French news site had to grapple with the apparent demise of Queen Elizabeth II of England; Pelé, the Brazilian soccer legend; Clint Eastwood; Brigitte Bardot; and dozens of other celebrities and world leaders.*

--

> *As it turned out, the website of Radio France Internationale had mistakenly published about 100 prewritten obituaries for prominent figures.*

--

> *Several hours after the obituaries first ran on Monday, the public radio station, which broadcasts in France and abroad, apologized and started taking the reports offline. It said unedited drafts had been accidentally published as it moved its website to a new content management system. Online platforms like Google and Yahoo News then automatically picked up some of the articles.*

--

> *The radio station said in a statement that it wanted to “apologize first and foremost to those concerned by these obituaries” and who might have been hurt by the premature announcement of the deaths.*

Aurelien Breeden at [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/world/europe/france-website-obituaries.html)

---

# importance of processes

--

> *While others have mentioned their amazement at the amount of people involved in this process (I also find that amazing), I think the sheer amount of processes that the information goes through is crazy.*
