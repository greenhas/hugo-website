# why did all of this matter?

# "Everyone that was paying attention knew that computing was going to change the fabric of economy, warfare, communication, everything."

# Simon: The best estimates I could find say that around that time, in the entire country, with a population of nearly a billion people, there were only 3,000 computers in use.

# Tom: Why is that? Well, the simple reason is the Chinese language could not fit inside a computer.

# "today, there are more than 70,000 of these Chinese characters. Each a unique visual representation of a word or an idea. The problem was, in the 1970s, computers had only a few bytes of memory. Not even enough to store a single email message."

# "At that time, there was the saying that computers are the gravediggers of Chinese characters"

# "tons of folks in the field of computing were arguing, 'We've got to replace Chinese with Esperanto or with English or with something else so that we can participate in global modernity.'"

# "This Chinese writing goes back at least 3,000 years."

# "So that when a Chinese kindergartner begins developing literacy and reading and writing, they learn Pinyin at the same time or even earlier than they start to learn Chinese characters."

Tom Mullaney in (Radiolab, 2020)

# "When we use Pinyin to type, we lose sight of the Chinese characters form and the form is the soul of a character. It's like you're grabbing hold of a person and doing a way with their flesh. You can't express the meaning of a Chinese character by its sound. The more people use Pinyin, the more screwed Chinese characters are."

# "[A]lthough when we think of the Chinese language, we think, oh, there's Mandarin and Cantonese. In reality, when it comes to speaking, there are dozens of different Chinese languages, Cantonese, Shanghainese, Fujianese. Languages that sound totally different, but on the page look the exact same because they're all using the same characters."

# "German philosophers had this idea that the hammer isn't just a tool, the hammer actually feeds back. The hammer changes the hand. It's interesting to me that this arbitrary leftover arguably outdated QWERTY keyboard that we're all stuck with is actually influencing our preferences when it comes to naming our offspring."
