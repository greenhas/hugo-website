# step 1: take a picture (or two) of (almost) all of the ports on your Raspberry Pi 

## RJ45 (Ethernet) and GPIO aren't necessary

---

class: center, middle

# step 2: referencing Chapter 10, make sure you can identify each type of port that's available on your Raspberry Pi

## (one port wasn't covered in Chapter 10, so I'll be less picky here)

---

class: center, middle

# step 3: create a Google Slides deck, one slide per type of port

---

class: center, middle

# step 4: use arrows and textboxes to point out one of the parts you're identifying; describe the technology, capabilities of that technology, and at least one associated peripheral

---

class: center, middle

# step 5: set Slides deck so I can access it and submit it through Canvas

# what other accessibility needs are there with input/output? what software and hardware solutions have you seen to this?

# "The text to speech and speech to text allows the visually impaired to hear texts and other information usually are displayed on the screen. "

Sean McCormick

## "Then one I use most (and not for its likely intended purpose) is the speech service. Sometimes, like in cases where I'm writing a paper, I might have already read over the paper once of twice previously, but I'm able to leverage this tool to discover spelling mistakes and grammatical errors I managed to skip over. It is really helpful."

# "There is an input device for the iPhone that lets people that are blind use there phone. It uses the speakers to tell them what is happening. I have seen some people use it before and it is pretty responsive for what its intended to do."

# "There is a software called VoiceOver that works in tandem with this display to let the user know what commands they are inputting. Instead of an instant 'touch-and-go' model, users use their finger to locate applications. "

# "I know on the iPhone they have voice over for the visually impaired. You tap once to hear the item you tapped on and twice to select that option. There is also another option called voice control to select and app by using your voice,"

Grant Lewis

# "Additionally, users can organize their apps in order, like a book, and swipe until the reach the app they want. The app takes up the entire screen and this makes sure blind users don't accidentally select the wrong application. "

# "For accessibility settings on my IPad it gives me the option of choosing between contracted braille or uncontracted braille. And the option of 6 or 8 uncontracted dot braille."

# "For those who are visually impaired you are able to change display and text size on your iPhone, instead of having a small text size you can have a much larger text size. "
