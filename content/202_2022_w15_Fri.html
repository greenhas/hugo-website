# "I thought that the social engineering tactic of getting one piece of information from an agent from a company, then trying for more information from other agents, was the most surprising tactic I saw. "

# " One of the most surprising social engineering tactics that I saw was hackers gaining information of someone through their online help chats. Its crazy to think that a company will give away someone's information so easy, especially when that could end up in allowing them control of your phone and bank account."

# "The social engineering tactics that surprised me the most is simply that human error. How you only need one employee out of the whole group to tell all. How it's so easy to be rejected by one agent but the company has multiple people to go too. "

# "With the popularity of two-factor authentication, I would make sure to opt-in on any security measure that requires more than just a password in order to help keep my accounts safe."
