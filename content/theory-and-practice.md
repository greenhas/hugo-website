You are the crew of the interstellar scout ship Raptor. Your mission is to explore uncharted regions of space, deal with aliens both friendly and deadly, and defend the consortium worlds against space dangers. Captain DarCy has been overcome by the strange psychic entity known as Something Else, leaving you to fend for yourselves while he recovers in a medical pod.

## Players: Create Characters

1. choose a style for your character: alien, android, dangerous, hot-shot, intrepid, savvy, or sexy. 
2. choose a role for your character: Doctor, envoy, engineer, explorer, pilot, scientist, or soldier. 
3. choose your number, from 2 to 5. A high number means you’re better at lasers (technology; science; cold rationality; calm, precise action). A low number means you’re better at FeelinGs (intuition; diplomacy; seduction; wild, passionate action).
4. Give your character a cool space adventure name. like sparks McGee or something.
**You have**: a consortium uniform (with built-in vacc-suit for space walks), a super-sweet space-phone-camera- communicator-scanner thing (with universal translator), a variable-beam phase pistol (set to stun, usually).
**Player goal**: Get your character involved in crazy space adventures and try to make the best of them.
**Character goal**: choose one or create your own: become Captain, Meet sexy aliens, shoot bad Guys, Find new worlds, solve weird space Mysteries, prove yourself, or keep being awesome (you have nothing to prove).

## Players: Create the ship
As a group, pick two strengths for the Raptor: Fast, nimble, well-armed, powerful shields, superior sensors, Cloaking Device, Fightercraft.
Also, pick one problem: Fuel hog (always needs energy crystals), only one Medical pod (and captain Darcy is in it), horrible Circuit breakers (in battle, consoles tend to explode on the bridge), Grim reputation (captain Darcy did some bad stuff in the past).

## Rolling the Dice

When you do something risky, roll 1d6 to find out how it goes. roll +1d if you’re prepared and +1d if you’re an expert. (The GM tells you how many dice to roll, based on your character and the situation.) roll your dice and compare each die result to your number.
⬇ If you’re using lasers (science, reason), you want to roll under your number.
⬆ If you’re using feelings, (rapport, passion) you want to roll over your number.
0. **If none of your dice succeed**, it goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse somehow.
1. **If one die succeeds**, you barely manage it. The GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost. 
2. **If two dice succeed**, you do it well. Good job!
3. **If three dice succeed**, you get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get. 
! **If you roll your number exactly**, you have **LASER FEELINGS**. You get a special insight into what’s going on. Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. some good questions:
- What are they really feeling? 
- Who’s behind this?
- How could I get them to _____?
- What should I be on the lookout for? 
- What’s the best way to _____?
-  What’s really going on here?
You can change your action if you want to, then roll again.
**HELPING**: if you want to help someone else, who’s rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. if you succeed, give them +1d.
