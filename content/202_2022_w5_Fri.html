# "The way Salima found out that Boulangism had gone bankrupt: her toaster wouldn’t accept her bread."

# "The toaster surprised me the most in this story because I have never really thought something so simple like a toaster would be implemented into a somewhat complicated piece of technology."

# "there was no one answering Salima’s toaster when it asked if the bread she was about to toast had come from an authorized Boulangism baker, which it had."

# "One example was when Microsoft first launched the Xbox One, and you always had to be connected to the internet to play games. And like the story, if there were server issues, you wouldn't be able to play games, turning your brand new Xbox into a brick."

# "Her Boulangism didn’t go easily. After downloading the new firmware from the darknet, she had to remove the case... and locate a specific component and then short out two of its pins with a pair of tweezers while booting it. This dropped the toaster into a test mode that the developers had deactivated, but not removed."

# "I also thought it was interesting how they devoted different elevators to other people that worked in the same building. This was kinda shocking as it really made me think about how could a company get away with that without violating many different rules that they are supposed to follow. "

# "The only reason she’d been able to rent in this building was that the developer had to promise that they’d make some low-income housing available in exchange for permission to build fifty stories instead of the thirty that the other buildings in the neighborhood rose to."

# "The kitchen had 'all major appliances,' just as advertised... They all started working once she’d input her debit-card number, and they presented her with menus of approved consumables: the dishes that would work in the dishwasher, the range of food that would work with the toaster, from bread to ready-meals."

# "Companies should let the users of these technologies have a little more freedom to tinker with the firmware because the user also did buy these technologies, so they should be able to really do as much as they please with the technologies if they happen to break down."

# "Amazon's action flies in the face of what people expect when they purchase a book. Under the 'right of first sale' in the U.S., people can do whatever they like with a book after purchasing it, including giving it to a friend or reselling it. There is no option for a bookseller to take that book back once it's sold."

# "'But it’s not the bread that’s copyrighted, it’s the software in the toaster, all the stuff we change when we jailbreak it... So if it has code in it, and there’s an access control, you’re not allowed to change the code. Even if it belongs to you!'"

# "I believe — really believe — in the stirring words of the Maker Manifesto: if you can't open it, you don't own it. Screws not glue. The original Apple ][+ came with schematics for the circuit boards, and birthed a generation of hardware and software hackers who upended the world for the better."

# "I don't necessarily disagree that certain device or appliance components shouldn't be repaired or modified (but I do agree that it should not be penalized), like with strictly proprietary technology, but the replacement parts should be made available to consumers at a fair price without an undue denial or inference."

# "Me personally, I wouldn't attempt to hack to modify my firmware if I thought it would lead a trail back to me. However, I do feel think they were in a situation where no one was willing to help give them answers and the complications kept building up and it's better than not doing anything at all."

# "Like any computer, your Raspberry Pi has a motherboard and could not function without it."

---

class: center, middle 

# "Now that we've read about all of the fundamental hardware in a computer, you could probably take a look at your Raspberry Pi's motherboard and identify some of the different parts (or at least make educated guesses)."

---

class: center, middle 

# "With most Raspberry Pi models, the motherboard is exposed, so if you have one of those, you can just take a picture of the motherboard and get to work."

---

class: center, middle 

# "If you bought the course-recommended Raspberry Pi 400, though, you'd have to disassemble the computer to get to the motherboard, and while that's absolutely possible, I'd really rather not require that."

# "I don't expect perfect accuracy here."

# "we've all read enough that you ought to be able to make educated guesses, so I do care about the reasoning behind your identification, and I do expect you to do more than make wild guesses"

---

class: center, middle

# "Create four different slides, all of which have the image of your motherboard on them. On each slide, use arrows and textboxes to point out one of the parts you're identifying, explain what (you believe) it is and how you've made that identification, and describe what concept it relates to."
