# Academic Integrity at UK

--

* "I promise to pursue all endeavors with integrity and compete with honesty"

--

* cheating is not tolerated at UK, and consequences are much more severe than in high school

--

 * typical penalty for first offence is 0 on assignment or E in the course (but can be even more severe)
 
--

 * "XE" grade represents failure in a course due to academic offence; it cannot be removed
 
--

* academic offenses are reported to the registrar

--

 * penalties less than XE appear on your record but are usually kept private and don't appear on your transcript
 
--

 * if you commit a second academic offense, the minimum penalty is a failing grade for the course, and harsher penalties can be imposed

---

# Academic Ombud Office

--

* in general terms, an Ombud is someone tasked with resolving problems and conflicts as a neutral party

--

* for the 2021-2022 school year, Dr. Alice Turkington, Professor of Geography, is the UK academic ombud

--

* the UK Ombud office handles problems like:

--

 * grade disputes
 
--

 * admission/registration problems

--

 * academic issues related to disciplinary matters
 
--

 * perceived favoritism
