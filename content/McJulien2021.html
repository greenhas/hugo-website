My name is Spencer Greenhalgh, and I'm an assistant professor of information communication technology in the University of Kentucky's School of Information Science. 

I'm presenting today not only on behalf of myself but also two colleagues. As a general rule of thumb, if you hear any bad ideas in this presentaiton, they're probably my fault, and if you hear any good ideas, you should give the credit to my colleagues:

As a final introduction, I'd like to mention that after submitting this paper to AECT, we sent a full manuscript on this topic to the Journal of Applied Instructional Design. We've just had the good fortune of seeing it published in that journal in case you'd like to read it afterward.

Let's begin by going back in time to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th of this year. This attack brought considerable attention to some of the so-called "alternative" social media platforms that had emerged over the past  several years. For example...

## "As supporters of President Donald Trump took part in a violent riot at the Capitol, users of the social media service Parler posted videos of themselves and others joining the fray. ProPublica reviewed thousands of videos uploaded publicly to the service..."

Groeger, L. V., Kao, J., Shaw, A., Syed, M., Y Eliahou, M. (2021, January 17). What Parler saw during the attack on the Capitol. *ProPublica*. [https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/](https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/)

## "...angst over President Trump’s loss has resulted in a surge of downloads for Parler... [which has] been a central hub for many of the conservative protests against recent election results, including the ongoing “Stop the Steal” campaign."

Brandom, R. (2020, November 9). Parler, a conservative Twitter clone, has seen nearly 1 million downloads since Election Day. *The Verge*.

## "...the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a “free speech” alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists."

Roose, K. (2018, October 28). On Gab, an extremist-friendly site, Pittsburgh shooting suspect aired his hatred in full. *The New York Times* [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html)

## "Of those [223] documents, 73 reference Facebook....YouTube was the second most-referenced on 24. Instagram, a Facebook-owned company, was next on 20. Parler, the app that pledged protection for free speech rights and garnered a large far-right userbase, was mentioned in just eight."

Brewster, T. (2021, February 7). Sheryl Sandberg downplayed Facebook's role in the Capitol Hill siege—Justice Department files tell a very different story. *Forbes*. https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/07/sheryl-sandberg-downplayed-facebooks-role-in-the-capitol-hill-siege-justice-department-files-tell-a-very-different-story/
