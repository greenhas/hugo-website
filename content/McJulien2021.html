With introductions out of the way, let's set the stage for our reconsiderations of learning on social media.

???

Let's begin by going back in time to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th of this year. This attack brought considerable attention to some of the so-called "alternative" social media platforms that had emerged over the past  several years. For example...

---
class: center, middle

## "As supporters of President Donald Trump took part in a violent riot at the Capitol, users of the social media service Parler posted videos of themselves and others joining the fray."

Groeger, L. V., Kao, J., Shaw, A., Syed, M., Y Eliahou, M. (2021, January 17). What Parler saw during the attack on the Capitol. *ProPublica*. [https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/](https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/)

???

... the investigative journalism organization ProPublica noted that the Parler social media platform was a veritable treasure trove of thousands of videos and other data documenting what happened during the attack. Parler had existed since 2018, and had attracted some high-profile users like U.S. Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, but...

---

class: center, middle

## "...angst over President Trump’s loss has resulted in a surge of downloads for Parler... [which has] been a central hub for many of the conservative protests against recent election results..."

Brandom, R. (2020, November 9). Parler, a conservative Twitter clone, has seen nearly 1 million downloads since Election Day. *The Verge*. [https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias)

???

... it's moment in the limelight really came after the 2020 election, when its mobile apps saw nearly a million downloads in the week following Election Day, over half of which occurred after the election was called for Joe Biden.

---

## "The sense that traditional news outlets are irredeemably biased... is one of the driving factors in the establishment of right-wing media ecosystems."

Freelon, D., Marwick, A., & Kreiss, D. (2020). False equivalenceis: Online activism from left to right. *Science*, *3369*, 1197-1201. [https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb2428](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb2428)

???

This sudden flocking to Parler was in some ways simply a contemporary expression of complaints going back a century that mainstream media—and more recently, mainstream social media—is biased against conservative viewpoints and that a separate, right-leaning media ecosystem is necessary. Parler, like its predecessor and somewhat rival Gab, has tried to establish that separate ecosystem by painting mainstream social media platforms as censorious and promising to honor "free speech" on its platform.

---
class: center, middle

## "...the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a 'free speech' alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists."

Roose, K. (2018, October 28). On Gab, an extremist-friendly site, Pittsburgh shooting suspect aired his hatred in full. *The New York Times* [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html)

???

However, this "free speech" branding had already been called into question two years earlier, when the alleged perpetrator of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting posted a kind of farewell message on Gab before going out and killing 11 people and wounding 6 others. This drew popular attention to the white nationalist content that circulates on Gab, just as the Capitol attack would later draw popular attention to extremist content on Parler.

---
class: center, middle

## "Of those [223] documents, 73 reference Facebook....YouTube was the second most-referenced on 24. Instagram, a Facebook-owned company, was next on 20. Parler, the app that pledged protection for free speech rights and garnered a large far-right userbase, was mentioned in just eight."

Brewster, T. (2021, February 7). Sheryl Sandberg downplayed Facebook's role in the Capitol Hill siege—Justice Department files tell a very different story. *Forbes*. https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/07/sheryl-sandberg-downplayed-facebooks-role-in-the-capitol-hill-siege-justice-department-files-tell-a-very-different-story/

???

Now, there's an important caveat here; in the aftermath of the Capitol attack, Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg was one of many to point fingers at platforms like Gab and Parler for being responsible for the attack. However, as the Justice Department started to respond to the attacks, they frequently referred to data and documentation from mainstream platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube in charging 223 individuals associated with the attack. Extremist content is clearly not limited to extremist platforms.

Nonetheless, the emergence of platforms like Gab and Parler provides educational technology researchers with an opportunity to reconsider how we think about learning happening on technology platforms.

# "Miseducation" as Conceptual Framework

???

Before getting into specific reconsiderations, I want to discuss a concept that serves as throughline for all of our arguments.

---

class: center, middle

# "Any experience is mis-educative that has the effect of arresting or distorting the growth of further experience."

Dewey, J. (1938). *Experience and education*. Kappa Delta Pi.


???

This throughline comes in part from John Dewey, who argued that learning has a direction: There is good learning, and there is bad learning, and it's insufficient to talk about "just learning." Although Dewey does talk about this on the personal level, his writing is also deeply concerned with the relationship between democracy and education, and it's possible to apply his ideas to the growth and direction of society, not just individuals.

---

# "The 'educated Negroes'...  are taught to admire the Hebrew, the Greek, the Latin and the Teuton and to despise the African."

# "The oppressor has always indoctrinated the weak with this interpretation of the crimes of the strong."

Woodson, C. G. (1933). *The mis-education of the Negro*. 

???

In this same decade, Carter G. Woodson also condemned miseducation, emphasizing that formal curricula often promote the knowledge and values of a dominant race or social class at the expense of other students.

---
class: center, middle

# learning ≠ education

???

Drawing from these authors and others, we suggest that it is important to separate learning from education, with "education" designating learning that promotes individual and societal well-being and "miseducation" designating learning that degrades individual and societal well-being. By extension, therefore, we are inviting AECT attendees to consider possible distinctions between "educational technology" and "miseducational technology."

# Studying *Miseducation* on Social Media

???

This conceptual framework leads us to the first of our major arguments, that as we consider learning on social media, it is important for us to consider miseducative learning on these platforms. Those of us who have studied learning on social media have often faced criticism that real learning can't happen through such and such a platform, and in response, we've often been eager to justify and champion informal learning activities happening on social media.

---

class: center, middle

# "Facebook can act as an important site for the informal, cultural learning of being a student, with online interactions allowing roles to be learnt, values understood and identities shaped"

Selwyn, N. (2007). *Web 2.0 applications as alternative environments for informal learning—a critical review*. *OECD CERIKERIS International expert meeting on ICT and educational performance*. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

???

For example, Selwyn argued that whether or not students in the mid-2000s were learning anything from their syllabus on Facebook, they were learning how to be students, and that's worthy of our consideration.

---

class: center, middle

# "This suggests that #OWS represents a generative informal learning space that offers users ample opportunities to construct knowledge from a number of different perspectives."

Gleason, B. (2013). #Occupy Wall Street: Exploring informal learning about a social movement on Twitter. *American Behavioral Scientist*, *57*, 966–982. [https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764213479372](https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764213479372)

???

Likewise, Gleason has argued that a Twitter hashtag can be an effective learning space even if the subject matter might not appear on any K-12 syllabus. Lest you think that we're pointing fingers at others, I want to emphasize that my colleagues and I have also taken this approach.

# "Many involved in education disregard Twitter as inconsequential drivel, but this dismissiveness is increasingly indefensible considering the mounting body of formal research and teacher-tested uses."

Carpenter, J. P., & Krutka, D. G. (2014). How and why educators use Twitter: A survey of the field. *Journal of Research on Technology in Education*, *46*(4), 414-434. [https://doi.org/10.1080/15391523.2014.925701](https://doi.org/10.1080/15391523.2014.925701)

???

Dan has written some of the most influential papers that argue for taking teachers' social media use seriously as professional learning,

---
class: center, middle

# "The co‐existence of... different kinds of learning underlines the importance of broader views of learning—especially when considering social media."

Greenhalgh, S. P., Nnagboro, C, Kaufmann, R., & Gretter, S. (2021). Academic, social, and cultural learning in the French #bac2018 hashtag. *Educational Technology Research and Development*, *69*(3), 1835-1851. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-021-10015-6

???

and just recently, my co-authors and I argued that we have to look beyond strictly-defined academic learning to appreciate what's happening on social media.  And yet, a broad definition of learning quickly starts to include miseducational examples.

---

class: center, middle

# "memes, specialised jokes, and jargon... reinforc[e] these virtual communities’ beliefs, while also acting as a means of identity creation and formation."

Conway, M., Scrivens, R., & Macnair, L. (2019). Right-wing extremists’ persistent online presence: History and contemporary trends. International Centre for Counter-Terrorism. The Hague. Policy Brief. https://doi.org/10.19165/2019.3.12

???

For example, Conway and colleagues suggest that in far-right communities, memes and jokes reinforce beliefs and support identity creation. Now, you could take this sentence verbatim from this report and put it into an article using sociocultural frameworks to validate the use of social media as learning, and a reader might not notice the difference.

---

class: center, middle

# "Among fascist activists 'red-pilling' means converting someone to fascist, racist and anti-Semitic beliefs."

Evans, R. (2018, October 11). From memes to Infowars: How 75 fascist activists were “red-pilled.” Bellingcat. https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled/

???

Likewise, far-right communities openly talk about "red-pilling," a process of learning or teaching that brings people on board with problematic beliefs. We may all disagree with what is being learned, but it's hard to contest that some kind of learning is happening.

---
class: center, middle

# learning vs. education

???

The solution here is not necessarily to restrict our definition of learning. The reason social media researchers have often embraced broad views of learning is because narrow views of learning have often dismissed phenomena of real interest and real value. However, the fact that these theories of learning can account for both students' use of Facebook and white nationalists' use of Gab suggests that we need to start making some important distinctions. Woodson, Dewey, and others give us the option of distinguishing between learning and education, and we ought to start paying more attention to both the possibility of miseducation and the reality of miseducation in social media spaces.

# Social Media Platforms are not Neutral Learning Spaces

???

The second lesson that we can learn from Gab and Parler is that social media platforms are not neutral learning spaces.

---

# social media platforms and ed tech research

--

* MySpace

--

* Facebook

--

* Twitter

--

* Instagram

--

* Reddit

--

* YouTube

--

* Pinterest

--

* Voxer

--

* TikTok

--

* Edmodo

???

We can get a sense of this non-neutrality if we think about just how many social media platforms ed tech researchers have considered. I'm aware of research that has considered:

---

class: center, middle

# why **not** Gab and Parler?

???

Given that our field has been so willing to study all of these different platforms, the obvious question seems to be why couldn't we study learning happening on Gab or Parler? And yet, I'd expect that most ed tech researchers would feel hesitant about that, that there's something inherent to these platforms that would make the activity there either uninteresting or unattractive to education researchers. If that's your gut reaction, I think there's probably something to that.

---

# "The majority of platforms, once taken over by corporations, gradually implemented professional and (semi)automated forms of governance."

Van Dijck, J. (2013). *The culture of connectivity: A critical history of social media.* Oxford University Press.

???

For example, social media scholar José Van Dijck has argued that to understand a social media platform, we need to understand—among other things—how content on that platform is governed, with most platforms having terms of service and other policies that govern content on the platform. For example, even Gab, despite marketing itself as a free speech platform, does not allow users to post certain kinds of content, including pornography. In contrast, though, the CEO of Gab has officially stated that

#"I see nothing wrong with this [QAnon] and we gladly welcome it on Gab.com."

Torba, A. (2020, November 30). *A discussion with Business Insider about QAnon* [Blog post]. [https://news.gab.com/2020/11/30/a-discussion-with-business-insider-about-qanon/](https://news.gab.com/2020/11/30/a-discussion-with-business-insider-about-qanon/)

???

He sees nothing wrong with and even welcomes users affiliated with the QAnon conspiracy theory, which holds that high-ranking U.S. politicians are part of a cannibalistic, Satan-worshipping ring of pedophiles. Although Gab is clearly willing to moderate some content, their unwillingness to moderate conspiracy theories and White nationalist content does affect the overall educational nature of the site. I wouldn't rule out the possibility that real education could hypothetically happen on Gab, but governance and moderation decisions like these clearly tilt it in a miseducative direction.

---

class: center, middle

#"According to her [Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen] they [algorithms] are meant to drive engagement and the company has found that the best engagement is the kind instilling fear and hate in users."

Cranz, A., & Brandom, R. (2021, October 3). Facebook encourages hate speech for profit, says whistleblower. *The Verge*. [https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation)

???

Once again, while Gab provides a clear and extreme example of the non-neutrality of platforms, it's important for us to remember that this is just as true of mainstream social media platforms. Facebook has been in the news a lot recently, but one of the most interesting allegations against the platform is that its engagement algorithms disproportionately boost toxic and misinformational content. Again, I'm confident that true education does happen on Facebook, but it's important to consider the ways that Facebook's very design promotes certain kinds of miseducation. Having applied this reasoning to Gab and then to Facebook, I think it's important that we move this lesson beyond social media and consider how educational technologies broadly are also non-neutral platforms for learning.

---

#"...we of all organizations understand that systems also have constraints. The integration requires security protocols that prevent sharing Zoom meeting links."

???

And so, at the risk of nibbling on the hand that feeds us all at this conference, I think it's worth considering this passage from an email that we all received a couple of weeks ago. The email explained that the conference technology we're using this year prevents sharing Zoom meeting links, restricting sessions to paid and registered attendees. This is an understandable decision, and it's true that AECT members ought to understand that all educational technologies have constraints. However, it seems unlikely to me that this is a simple technical limitation that AECT or our corporate partners can't work around and more likely to me that this is a deliberate decision on the part of the platform's designers to restrict attendance of virtual conference sessions, and that this feature was either embraced or at least accepted by planners of this conference. Again, that's an understandable decision, but I think it's dangerous to treat this as "just how this technology works" instead of recognizing that it's been designed in particular ways that enforce particular learning values, and that we have the option to design or employ technologies differently in order to embrace other learning or educational values.

# Relationships Between Informal Miseducation and Formal Education

???

The third lesson that Gab and Parler can teach us is to reconsider relationships between formal and informal learning by entertaining the possibility of informal miseducation influencing formal learning. In saying this, I want to make it clear that my co-authors and I don't want to reinforce a simplistic dichotomy between informal and formal learning; the reality of learning is much more complicated than that. However, distinguishing between formal and informal learning has often been helpful for educational technology researchers, so we've cautiously embraced the terminology.

#"...can we nurture learning by seeding informal learning environments with supportive resources that help sustain self-perpetuating processes?"

Barron, B. (2006). Interest and self-sustained learning as catalysts of development: A learning ecology perspective. *Human Development*, *49*, 193-224. [https://doi.org/10.1159/000094368](https://doi.org/10.1159/000094368)

???

Many scholars who have speculated on the relationship between informal and formal learning have expressed some hope that what learners pick up outside of school will inform and drive their learning in more formal environments.

---

#"Although several studies have explored teens’ informal literacy practices online, research investigating how these spaces may inform or be effectively utilized in the classroom remains inconclusive."

Galvin, S., & Greenhow, C. (2020). Writing on social media: A review of research in the high school classroom. *TechTrends*, *64*, 57-69. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11528-019-00428-9

???

For example, Galvin and Greenhow noted how much writing teenagers are doing on social media and ask the almost inevitable question—how can we use this to support formal learning? However, the presence of online learning spaces like Gab and Parler turns this assumption around.

#"Once students learn these conspiracies and start to buy into them, they bring them to school..."

Koul, S. (2020, October 29). These teachers are struggling to pull their students out of a QAnon rabbit hole. *BuzzFeed News*. [https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scaachikoul/qanon-conspiracy-theories-teenagers-school](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scaachikoul/qanon-conspiracy-theories-teenagers-school)

???

For example, just before the election, a reporter at BuzzFeed news wrote a story about some teachers' efforts to deal with the conspiracy theories that their students were bringing to school, having learned them from their families or from social media. This is a case of informal miseducation that's getting in the way of formal education, and it's a phenomenon worthy of our attention.

# one teacher-oriented group on Gab seemed to have over 18,000 members as of March 2021

Lee, M. (2021, March 15). Inside Gab, the online safe space for far-right extremists. *The Intercept*. [https://theintercept.com/2021/03/15/gab-hack-donald-trump-parler-extremists/](https://theintercept.com/2021/03/15/gab-hack-donald-trump-parler-extremists/)

???

Perhaps worse is the possibility of teachers engaging in informal miseducation that affects their ability to ensure that true education is happening in their classrooms. There are several examples of teachers going to Washington, D.C. to participate in the Capitol attack or support the rioters, and after Gab was hacked in March 2021, one reporter identified a teacher-oriented group on the site as being the second-largest private group on the platform (though I have some data about this group that suggests that activity levels are far lower than those numbers suggest). Nonetheless, after nearly a decade of studying how teachers are engaging in self-directed learning on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with the hope that they are benefiting from that learning in their classrooms, it may be time to start asking ourselves what some teachers are learning in toxic online spaces, crossing our fingers that it doesn't extend to their classrooms.

# is formal learning sufficiently *educational*?

???

All of this raises concerns that ought to shift our attention from informal learning on social media to formal learning in schools. Are our systems of formal learning sufficiently educational to withstand miseducation creeping in from students', teachers', and other stakeholders' miseducative learning on social media and in other spaces?

# "for communities of color... [t]he purpose of state-sanctioned schooling has been to forward the largely assimilationist and often violent White imperial project"

Alim, H.S., & Paris, D. (2017). What is culturally sustaining pedagogy and why does it matter? In D. Paris & H. S. Alim (Eds.), Culturally sustaining pedagogies: Teaching and learning for justice in a changing world (pp. 1-21). Teachers College Press.

???

Writing nearly a century after Woodson, Alim and Paris suggest that for communities of color, modern schools remain miseducative. Formal curricula that subtly embed White supremacy may be tamer than what is found on Gab or Parler, but they are not likely to be strong enough to resist and correct miseducation happening in those spaces.
