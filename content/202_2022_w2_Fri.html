# "It was basically a calculator, and from the readings in class, a computer is anything that performs calculations, so once I started to think about it, I realized that there was more of a connection than I initially thought."

# "Since Covid has started, society has turned to computers to do so much more, so we can prevent people from being sick, but still getting work done with improvements like Zoom and many different apps that allow people to get their work done without physically being around people."

# "I think in that few decades there will be an increasingly large push for working at home especially after the last few years as most have access to wifi and computers and if they don't companies will often provide it so they do not have to lease out office space."

# "I believe that society will become more computer-dependent than it is right now and that can be a bad thing because employment can be predicted to go down in a lot of job titles. Companies are not going to want to pay someone to do a job that a computer can do for free."

# "For example, our power grid in the United States is run by a computer. A few years ago Russia was able to hack into Ukraine's power grid and make them go dark for hours while engineers just sat there, because there was nothing they could do. What would we do if the same situation happened in the United States?"

# "In the age of globalization, I think computers and the connectivity of networks such as the internet are creating a merged global culture. Of course, there will still be cultural traditions from all over the world that exist, but one of the negative aspects of computers is this homogeneity. However, a positive aspect could be the sharing of knowledge in faster ways than we could in all of human history."

# "The shortage means the company hasn't been able to buy enough chips used to determine whether a printer cartridge is 'genuine' or 'authorized,' and therefore has had to start selling cartridges without DRM, and issue guidance helping users do an end around for the company's own obnoxious DRM warnings"
