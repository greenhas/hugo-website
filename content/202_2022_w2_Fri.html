# "For example, our power grid in the United States is run by a computer. A few years ago Russia was able to hack into Ukraine's power grid and make them go dark for hours while engineers just sat there, because there was nothing they could do. What would we do if the same situation happened in the United States?"

# "I believe that society will become more computer-dependent than it is right now and that can be a bad thing because employment can be predicted to go down in a lot of job titles. Companies are not going to want to pay someone to do a job that a computer can do for free."

# "In the age of globalization, I think computers and the connectivity of networks such as the internet are creating a merged global culture. Of course, there will still be cultural traditions from all over the world that exist, but one of the negative aspects of computers is this homogeneity. However, a positive aspect could be the sharing of knowledge in faster ways than we could in all of human history."
