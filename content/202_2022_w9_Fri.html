## "PHIA: Blumberg felt about it the way I did. Phishing is for dummies. But then a month later, news came out that the President of France, his campaign got phished, like some of his staffers ended up handing over their personal passwords. And actually, I started to notice that a lot of the hacks that I‚Äôm reading about recently, they start with phishing‚ÄîJohn Podesta, that was phishing, the Sony hack by North Korea‚Äîthat was phishing."

# The Phishing techniques I was most impressed by was the email that contained the audio file that requested a password. It was made to look professional when asking for the password and if the guy had not known that phishing simulations were happening, then he probably would have entered his password.

# Using a server located in New York is a technique that surprised me the most. I realized that in most untargeted phishing attempts, the attacker likely would not have the information to identify the precise location of the victim (i.e. if the attacker was using an email list), but in a targeted attack, the attacker has probably conducted extensive research to maximize the impact of their attack.

Jared Hyde

# "And the server he was using was actually based in New York, so if you check where you‚Äôve recently signed into Gmail, it will show a New York-based location, which is what Daniel says, they would really do if it was a targeted phishing attempt."

# If the email account of an important IT admin is compromised, it has the potential for serious consequences. Though, I contend some risks are diminished more than others, especially in environments where privileged identify management (a.k.a. just in time access) is leveraged.

If somebody got access to my account it would also put my contacts in harms way because who's to say the hacker won't carbon copy everybody on the contacts list and send that email out to gain access to more accounts?

I'm not that gullible like if my friends sent me something I would think it was a joke, but if my brother sent me a link for something I would probably click on it.
