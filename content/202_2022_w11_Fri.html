# When a particular OS looks interesting, you'll want to do some independent research to learn more about that OS and consider whether you would try installing it on your Raspberry Pi. 

---

class: center, middle

# You will want to identify at least two operating systems (not including Raspberry Pi OS and any of its variants) that pique your interest.

---

class: center, middle

# Write one paragraph for each of the two operating systems that you would consider installing on your Raspberry Pi; be sure to mention why you're interested in that OS, what it is like, and what you would use it for.

---

class: center, middle

# At this point, we've read several chapters touching on operating systems—write a third paragraph making notes of anything you noticed during this activity that relates back to what you've learned about operating systems over the past few modules.

# "We’ve passed a milestone in Google’s evolution from search engine to walled-garden. In June of 2019, for the first time, a majority of all browser-based searches on Google.com resulted in zero-clicks."

Fishkin, R. (2019, August 13). Less than half of Google searches now result in a click. *SparkToro*. https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/

# "While their tactics may seem underhanded, users also have the choice of using any software available to them, either Apple’s OS or open sourced. They just want to develop features to make more money and bring in new customers."

# "One of the most objectionable thing about apple is how they abuse there power just a tad bit. Such as subjecting certain companies fees that directly compete with apple."

Grant Lewis

class: center, middle

# "One point that is objectionable are the fee's Apple has for subscriptions processed on its platform. Quite a bummer when fortnite was purged from the app store just because it violated the payment terms of Apple."

William Nicholson

# "Unlike Google’s Android, which allows the “sideloading” of apps from outside the company’s official app store, Apple maintains a vise grip on user behavior in iOS. When Apple purged Fortnite from the App Store last year for violating its payment terms, iPhone users had no recourse."

# "It is certainly true that Apple, like all other brands, tries to lock you in, but there are benefits for customers who buy into their ecosystem. The interoperability between different Apple devices (i.e., the iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, iPad, etc.) is sublime and others try to mimic this."

# "In my experience I have tried out apple AirPods just because they were easily compatible with my iPhone and my pre-notion that they would be as useful as my iPhone. I think accessories like this are one way apple keeps their customers coming back to buy more."

# "Some do this by making products that connect automatically when using a certain device with a certain operating system on it. Another way would just make things only go across to the one operating system meaning you can only use certain really handy features on that operating system. "

# "Another way [Microsoft] develop the OS is through their office platform. With a Microsoft PC you're getting the full Office experience whereas with a Mac you're getting limited features. For example in word the Mac version lacks the ink option, and they even don't have access to Publisher which is a handy app."

# "I use an Android device, and Google has its hand in almost everything on my device. I use Gmail, Google search and google photos. The experience is great, but if I want to move from the Google world, I would be hard-pressed to find suitable non-Google applications that would provide the functionality that the Gsuite provides. "

# "Apple has, for the most part, avoided the appearance of outright malevolence—a contrast with some of its Big Tech contemporaries. But it is also, in the end, operating toward the same end goals: growth and profit. For that reason, if not others, consider well how much of your life you cede to its digital realm."
