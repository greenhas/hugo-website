> *Way back in the beginning, or at least the early 1990s, the Internet was made up of a bunch of websites constructed from hand-coded strands of HTML.*

Kyle Chayka, [In the Shadow of the CMS](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/)

--

> *As Moore mentioned, creating a CMS using HTML code can be laborious, so it is convenient there are third-party sites and companies that assist with this process.*

Allison Turner

--

> *When GeoCities launched in 1995, there were only a few million people on the Internet. The service provided an interface for users to more easily build and publish their sites, and it hosted domains and thematic directories—it was, in essence, one of the first freely and widely available content management systems.*

# content management systems

--

> *A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/content-management-system/)

--

> *Readers never really think twice about the back end of the process. They care about a smooth user experience. Whereas the engineers, editors, and producers are the ones who have to worry about the "behind the scenes" aspects of the CMSs.*

Taylor Worthington

--

> *I'm familiar with Vox and Funny or Die, and it really does surprise me that they all run on the same publishing tech.*

# content management systems

--

You can make some (blurry) distinctions between the following categories of CMS (see Barker's *Web Content Management*, chapter 1):

--

* web content management

--

* enterprise content management 

--

* component content management systems

--

* records management

--

* learning management systems

--

* digital asset management

--

> > > *quite a few people trying to watch the Tom and Jerry movie on HBO Max were instead shown the upcoming R-rated version of Justice League*

> > Mitchell Clark, [Tom and Jerry accidentally became the Snyder Cut for a hot minute](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22320439/snyder-cut-leaked-hbo-max-tom-and-jerry)

--

> > > *CMSs also increasingly influence not just how stories look but how they are produced, discovered, read, and monetized*

> > Kyle Chayka, [In the Shadow of the CMS](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/)


--

* provide governance

--

* effectively format content

# picking a CMS

--

> *The biggest consideration when deciding what CMS to use seems to be the depth of your website. ... I have used Wix a lot for small projects but have definitely ran into issues when wanting to do something not fully allowed.*

Conner Goldsmith

--

> *Knowing what you or the employee is capable of is important when choosing a CMS for your project.*

Taylor Worthington

--

> *Some considerations that influence what CMSs you use are the ability to implement custom programming, the ability to customize, ease of access, efficiency, and how user-friendly it is.*

Kaitlyn Wilson

---

# skillset

--

> *In the interview, Moore identified a need for both people with design and coding skills when working with CMSs.*

Quinn Troia

--

> *I liked how he mentioned that you don’t have to be a rockstar programmer or designer to work with CMSs and that it is important to have a little of both skills.*

# the bigger picture

--

> *the fight to control how content is distributed and how audiences are sold online, as well as who gets the money*

Kyle Chayka, [In the Shadow of the CMS](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/)

--

> *It's honestly really crazy to think about the power dominance big tech/social media companies have in the industry/market and even the leverage they have when it comes to Capitol Hill.*

McKensie Millay

--

> *Facebook reportedly fielded complaints from political parties saying a major News Feed change pushed them toward negative, polarizing posts. Today, The Wall Street Journal posted leaked reports from Facebook after it boosted “meaningful social interactions” on the platform. While Facebook framed the move as helping friends connect, internal reports said it had “unhealthy side effects on important slices of public content, such as politics and news,” calling these effects an “increasing liability.”*

Adi Robertson, [Political parties told Facebook its News Feed pushed them into ‘more extreme positions’](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675472/facebook-wsj-leaks-news-feed-social-media-politics-polarization)

Conner Goldsmith

--

>  *If you enjoy any of this content, any of it at all, it is highly recommended that you take one measly second out of your life to actually navigate to any of our many, many articles that grace your social media feed for free. Or, hell, you could even look at our homepage once in a while. Because unless you actually visit the website, there eventually won’t be one...*

> *Not only would it be a good additional source of income, but it would be beneficial to the companies to be able to manage their own content without having to outsource to other companies.*
