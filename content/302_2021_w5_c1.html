# content management systems

> *Way back in the beginning, or at least the early 1990s, the Internet was made up of a bunch of websites constructed from hand-coded strands of HTML.*

Kyle Chayka, [In the Shadow of the CMS](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/)

--

> *When GeoCities launched in 1995, there were only a few million people on the Internet. The service provided an interface for users to more easily build and publish their sites, and it hosted domains and thematic directoriesâ€”it was, in essence, one of the first freely and widely available content management systems.*

> *A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/content-management-system/)

> *Readers never really think twice about the back end of the process. They care about a smooth user experience. Whereas the engineers, editors, and producers are the ones who have to worry about the "behind the scenes" aspects of the CMSs.*

Taylor Worthington

> *I'm familiar with Vox and Funny or Die, and it really does surprise me that they all run on the same publishing tech.*

You can make some (blurry) distinctions between the following categories of CMS (see Barker's *Web Content Management*, chapter 1):

--

* web content management

--

* enterprise content management 

--

* component content management systems

--

* records management

--

* learning management systems

--

* digital asset management

--

> *quite a few people trying to watch the Tom and Jerry movie on HBO Max were instead shown the upcoming R-rated version of Justice League*
