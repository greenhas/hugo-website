# what is a channel? 

--

> *A distribution outlet for content; a method in which content is consumed.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/channel/)

--

* what content do you consume?

--

* which channels is it available through?

---

# how should we think about channels?

--

> *I liked how Meagan talked about the differences between the different social media platforms and how you have to change your strategy depending on what platform you are posting to.*

Mollie Nave

--

> *Megan talks about using Instagram and Facebook over Twitter because of her familiarity with the former social media platforms... she explained the different potential audiences of platforms like Twitter or Facebook*

Quinn Troia

--

> *An organization might consider managing content across multiple channels so they can ensure the fact that their content is reaching their target audience no matter what channel they prefer/solely use. [...] Some practical concerns... are how channels format their specific posts and content, how much or how little content can be published, and if the content they're posting follows each channels' guidelines.*

# multichannel distribution

> *Systems that can publish content to more than one channel are called multi-channel.*

have any of you worked with multichannel systems? can you think of any examples?

> *appear on the intranet.*

>  *be emailed to an internal mailing list.*

>  *be syndicated in an RSS feed.*

>  *be emailed to a third-party (the contractor, perhaps?)*

>  *be posted to an internal calendar.*

>  *be published in a department’s print newsletter.*

>  *appear on various LCD TVs around the building.*

>  *appear in other system – an interstitial login window (“Important Announcements!”) when customer services reps sign in, for instance.*

>  *be transmitted to other parties via a Web service or other method (press releases go to PRNewswire or something)*

>  *be sent to mobile devices via SMS.*

# multichannel distribution

> *By Deane Barker • Posted on April 11, 2009*

--

> *I think it's interesting how times have changed because some of these channels are hardly used now whereas social media is now often a big player in communicating announcements/updates to people. For example, I work at the Study and whenever we have a schedule change because a tutor is not in that day, we will post that to our social media accounts.*

> *The bigger problem is that they’ve abandoned interoperability. RSS, semantic markup, microformats, and open APIs all enable interoperability, but the big players don’t want that — they want to lock you in, shut out competitors, and make a service so proprietary that even if you could get your data out, it would be either useless (no alternatives to import into) or cripplingly lonely (empty social networks).*

> *When Spotify decided to try to become the biggest podcasting platform in the world, it knew it needed a nuclear weapon: Joe Rogan.*

Ashley Carman, [Joe Rogan, Confined to Spotify, Is Losing Influence](https://www.theverge.com/22632213/joe-rogan-experience-spotify-exclusive-audience-reach)

--

> *However, a new data investigation by The Verge finds that the powerful podcaster’s influence has waned since he went behind Spotify’s wall. His show has declined as a hype vehicle for guests, and Rogan’s presence as a mainstay in the news has plummeted.*

--

> *The show used to benefit from posting full episodes to YouTube, which usually received millions of views each and often led to snippets going viral on other platforms, like Twitter. But the YouTube channel now just hosts clips, which don’t always break the million-view milestone. Rogan also used to have visibility in other podcasting apps, which is important because not everyone uses Spotify. It’s possible that social media algorithms, and YouTube’s in particular, also helped Rogan and his guests gain a following.*

# channels, content, and presentation

--

> *It strikes me that an “announcement” in the context of the enterprise doesn’t necessarily correlate to a Web page. It’s really a pure…nugget of information, uncorrupted by presentation. It has properties like a title, a body, an author, etc. that are universal. They transcend presentation.*

Deane Barker, [Beyond Web-Centricity in Content Management](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/beyond-web-centricity-in-content-management/)

--

> *it was really interesting to see what kind of considerations have to be made for every single platform, such as the character limit with Twitter*
