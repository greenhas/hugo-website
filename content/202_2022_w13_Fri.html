# what were advantages and disadvantages of networks in the show?

---

class: center, middle

# However, the disadvantage would be that if an enemy Cyclon were to board the ship, the computers could access crucial information/locations of valuable objects or people, which is how it could lead to deaths.

# how about real life?

---

class: center, middle

# A few benefits for me that I have to apply to my daily life is being able to access the internet, I have to have access to the internet as a student, so I can do what I need to do. In addition, being able to have a network allows me to do my job at work, and work with the small local network.

# Having multiple machines that spit out money to hundreds of people a day, and having them on the same network, could allow for a simple and easy process for many people to access their money in a short period of time.

# I also love (but also can't stand sometimes) the eduroam network.

# Another benefit is that a network can also improve storage because more things can be stored on a cloud or over some kind of network.

# The hacker could demand some sort of money in exchange for the networked computers back, or just take all the information they want.

# Another downside of a network is that it lacks independence. Without a network, you pretty much just have a computer that does hard work and it is just a computer really.

# Not only is hacking a concern, but also companies being able to see exactly what you do. I am not a fan of that so by being networked, you are ultimately sacrificing a bit of privacy.

# We saw this in the 2011 RSA breach that compromised systems and servers (even those that were air-gapped) perpetrated by foreign actors. We see this happen with denial of service attacks, and we also see this in everyday computer malware.

# If someone can access an IP address over the school network, or cause the network to go down, I would not be able to use any of my school materials.
