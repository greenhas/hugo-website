Over the past several years, I've been semi-following conversations about [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) a social web annotation tool that's caught some attention in the ed tech community. Of all the ed tech tools out there, Hypothesis is notable for being managed by a non-profit (rather than a for-profit company) and—from what I've seen—being more readily (if not fully) embraced by the critical ed tech community than many of the other tools that exist. 

Last year, as a brand new faculty member, I was faced with the tricky task of wanting to create some [MAET](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/maet/)-quality online classes while no longer having access to the institutional history and established curriculum that made teaching for that program such a pleasure (this isn't a slight on my department's online teaching—which is quite good—so much as nostalgia for what was an amazing online teaching experience). Hypothesis seemed like a tool that I could use to start bring in the active and interactive elements that I appreciated in MAET to my own teaching. Hypothesis played an important part in the three (online **and** face-to-face) classes I taught last fall and spring, and I even got the chance to try out a Hypothesis integration for Canvas, the LMS we use here at UK. 

A few weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised to receive an email asking me to be a panelist on a webinar to talk about that experience trying out Hypothesis in Canvas (and to learn about the direction that the integration is going in). Hypothesis won't be the right tool for all classes (I'm leaving it out of one of my Fall classes because it's not as relevant as other tools), and not all institutions are going to go for the full Canvas integration (though I'm hoping that UK will), but I am looking forward to seeing where Hypothesis goes and wanted to share a link to the webinar:
