As someone with an education PhD who teaches and researches outside traditionally education topics, I want to emphasize that the prevalence of education PhDs is a symptom, not the actual problem. In my teaching and research outside my home discipline, I work hard to learn the content and communities that I'm branching into. The disdain for those content and communities at BYU Religious Education is the real problem here and therefore what I'm really worried about. To channel Shulman, this is a context that values pedagogical knowledge at the expense of content knowledge; there are lots of academic departments out there that make the opposite mistake, but that doesn't justify this approach either. [link to 'Religious Education at BYU: An Open Letter to the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities | By Common Consent, a Mormon Blog'](https://bycommonconsent.com/2022/03/04/religious-education-at-byu-an-open-letter-to-the-northwest-commission-on-colleges-and-universities/)
