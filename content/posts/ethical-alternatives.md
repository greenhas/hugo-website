Thanks to a [Lifehacker article](https://lifehacker.com/find-ethical-open-source-alternatives-to-almost-every-a-1833746899), I recently discovered ethical.net and its list of [alternatives and resources](https://ethical.net/resources/) to popular tech services. 

Making the switch to privacy-focused (and, to a lesser extent, environmental-focused) tech has been a big focus of mine recently. I've cut a lot of Google out of my life (but not all of it) thanks to [DuckDuckGo](https://start.duckduckgo.com/) instead of Google, [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en) instead of Gmail, and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com) instead of Chrome. I'm not ready to give up Twitter, but I have dropped Facebook and am trying to get more involved with [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) instead. Swapping Slack out for [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) was also a pretty easy switch. 

That said, there's still plenty of the big companies in my life, and I am interested in continuing to find alternatives to the services I haven't been able to break away from. This list sounds like a great resource for doing so.
