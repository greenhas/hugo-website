I have never been a Republican, but I frequently voted GOP prior to 2016. Because my personal political views have shifted since then, it's hard to say whether I would vote for a GOP that throws off the Trump baggage, but I do hope such a party one day re-emerges. I may not agree with it, but we certainly need it. [link to 'Trump as a Modern-Day Party Boss: Hoarding Cash and Doling Out Favors - The New York Times'](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/us/politics/trump-mar-a-lago.html)
