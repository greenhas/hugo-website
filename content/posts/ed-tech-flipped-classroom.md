One of the perks of bringing an educational technology background into a different department and college is getting asked to share some of that background with other faculty. The UK School of Information Science—along with the College of Communication and Information—has been running some informal brownbags to help instructors get ready for an uncertain fall, and I was fortunate enough to be asked to share some of my perspective as an ed tech researcher. My presentation can be seen [here](https://uky.zoom.us/rec/play/75Mucbv--jM3HtGUsASDBKR4W9S8JqKshnIa8vFYyR21ByFXNVKuYeYWY7GMjWOi0tmlfB-jia2d9mUb?startTime=1595433577000&_x_zm_rtaid=kLQxdHtCT8-4-186UOA8IQ.1595944366168.037176caeb3a7ce28b603e07e38e9e4a&_x_zm_rhtaid=303), and the other videos can also be seen at [this link](https://ci.uky.edu/sis/page/school-information-science-hosts-lunch-learns).
