Reminds me of the time I was driving through Meyrin, took a wrong turn, and accidentally wound up in France—or when I would get from one side of the canton to the other during the awful rush hour by leaving Switzerland and taking a French autoroute around. Cities like Geneva really challenge the idea of borders. [link to 'Un manuel transfrontalier pour raconter l'histoire du Grand Genève - rts.ch - Genève'](https://www.rts.ch/info/regions/geneve/12446682-un-manuel-transfrontalier-pour-raconter-l-histoire-du-grand-geneve.html?rts_source=rss_t)
