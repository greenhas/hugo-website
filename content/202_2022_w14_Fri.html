# "As students throughout Kentucky prepare for a new school year and more remote learning amid a pandemic, the state should view internet access as a public good similar to electricity and school buses, several education and workforce leaders said Monday."

Kobin, B. (2020, August 3). As remote learning continues, leaders say Kentucky needs a 'New Deal' for internet access. *Louisville Courier Journal*, https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2020/08/03/leaders-say-kentucky-needs-new-deal-student-internet-access/5572555002/

# "The problem not only impacts rural parts of eastern and western Kentucky but also neighborhoods in cities such as Louisville and Lexington, they said."

# "Recent U.S. Census figures showed that Kentucky ranked 44th in the nation for broadband access, with roughly 25% of households lacking a subscription for high-speed internet and more than 15% of homes not having a computer."

# "'If we were to hear that a child doesn't have access to electricity in the home, we think about all of the repercussions for that and how that would impact his or her daily living and impact his or her access to the learning,' Lewis said, adding that Kentucky was the first state in the nation to ensure that all of its school districts had broadband access."

# "Now, being connected in some form or fashion is required for a job or to even receive basic assistance from the government. It we are going to demand that it be used by everyone, we need to radically change our view on the commercialization of basic Internet services and make it affordable."

Jared Hyde

# "The reason that I thought was most convincing from the articles was how people in rural areas of the community don't have everyday access to internet and it changes the learning curriculum and not all children's remote learning experiences are all the same."

Brianna Beaumont

# "I think that even if a person has internet access, they may not have a strong connection or as fast internet speed as other kids in some parts of the state, or even within their own school. With other economic and social divides, the internet is something else that can be seen as a luxury to some students."

Hunter Kohlsmith

# "While these points are very valid there is the idea that the internet is also a luxury,  I think that this way of thinking is valid but is just the wrong way to go about it as many people can not do basic tasks like homework or checking when they need to work without the internet. "

# "I think trying to get internet to everyone in Kentucky is a great idea, however we also run into the obstacle of money and capability. It would be extremely costly to get internet to every neighborhood and every rural house, and it may not even be possible. "

# "The reason being, the Kentucky education system provides grants for smart campuses so that school districts have the opportunity to purchase a laptop. "
