# "We want to introduce an approach to social media [in education] that does not just regard them as tools, but as platforms, driven by a complex interplay between technical architectures, business models, and mass user activity."

> *“Every morning before Cindy Price starts teaching her [students] in New Castle, Delaware, she fires up ClassDojo, a classroom communication app. She checks parent messages, finds out whether any students will be out sick and reads school news. When a [student] shows a trait like ‘amazing thinking’ or ‘great listening,’ she adds a point to the student's avatar—a personalized cartoonish monster—generating a bright ping! that makes classmates perk up. Points come off for disruptive behavior.”*
