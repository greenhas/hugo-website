# presentation

--

> *The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/presentation/)

--

> *What might be involved in modifying content for display is changing the visual layout, like text font, text color, size, and formatting, and trimming down the size of the content depending on which platform or audience it's being presented to.*

> *For example, the content will look different on a mobile app compared to a webpage or Twitter compared to Facebook so creators must take into consideration what will be the most visually appealing for the consumer.*

# separating content and presentation

--

> *The idea that content should be separate from presentation is so central to content management that’s it’s become a cliché *

Deane Barker, [Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/examining-the-separation-between-presentation-and-content/)

--

##two types of separation:

--

* Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the “presentation” is the use of colors, fonts, etc.

--

* Content from other content, so Content A is independent from Content B, and the “presentation” is the potential combination of the two

--

> *Modifying content could have some personalization done by AI to show the user what they want to see like with ads.*

> *[D]ifferent channels will have different requirements when it comes to presentation. Whereas online publications will generally be presented as it is formatted and they keep a pretty consistent format for presentation, print publications often have a lot more unique considerations with a designer and editor usually in the process...*

> *For their online channel, they can post daily articles and critical reports. The Kernel separates content from presentation based on whether the content being published is critical and needs to go out ASAP or not. They do this by having the reporter on the scene write on the fly and make sure they're fact-checking as quickly as possible in order to get the critical information out there.*

# can you really separate content from presentation?

> *For example, in political discourse, there is a tendency to think of presentation as “rhetoric,” separating the content of what is said (the truth) from how it is presented (the rhetoric); thus, the “Straight Talk Express” and the “No-Spin Zone.” This separation, of course, is ancient; as Gideon Burton notes in the “Silva Rhetoricae,” rhetoricians have long created and used a distinction “between what is communicated through language and how this is communicated.”*
