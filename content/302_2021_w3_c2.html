# odds and ends

--

* make sure you have notifications turned on for assignment comments; that's how I'll communicate with you about reports, etc.

--

* make sure to submit a direct link to the post, not just the site

--

* connect to one of the "I Can" statements—and make it obvious

--

* **prove**, don't just **describe**

--

* pay attention to dates as you continue writing reports

--

* *I can identify and employ technologies related to content management*

---

# content and mission

--

## what is the mission of your hypothetical organization?

--

## what is the relationship between content and that mission?

---

# content, mission, and the internet

--

> *I think some content creators only want to make it big on the internet, while other content creators take the traditional route.*

Taylor Worthington

--

> *I think this is true for the most part, however traditional media has also crept into sites such as Youtube.*

Will Hennis

--

> *However, more than ever there are people who see the internet as mainstream media and as the platform that matters most.*

Conner Goldsmith

# content and audiences

--

> *I never really thought about all the various audiences that colleges might have to engage with. The first one that came to my mind was content directed towards incoming students and the families supporting those students.*

Will Hennis

--

> *What stuck out most about this interview was the focus on audience when creating content for the College, and the ways that influenced how content was tailored to accomplish the goals of the College.*

Quinn Troia

---

# content as "stories"

--

> *That is a fantastic way to look at things, and is much less bland than just 'giving information' about the college. It makes it way more personal and meaningful in my opinion.*

Conner Goldsmith

---

# content and commerce

--

> *How did webcomic creators actually earn an income if that's all they did? If webcomics were free, I feel like being at the mercy of content viewers and their wallets is a huge risk if that was the only income model for them.*

McKensie Millay

--

> *To keep up my fabulous grad student lifestyle, I had to sell three shirts a day through TopatoCo. I was making $5 or $6 a shirt. One time, I didn’t sell any shirts all weekend. I emailed my friends like, “What’s happening, am I done?” Then I sold six shirts on Monday.*

Ryan North, in Ferguson (2019)

> *Artists increasingly rely on Patreon, book sales, and other sources of revenue, while new webcomics often pop up exclusively on Instagram, foregoing the expense of a dedicated site.*

Ferguson (2019)
