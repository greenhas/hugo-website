# application activity

---

class: center, middle

# To start this application activity, open up [this link](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/pacman-terminal) and follow the instructions step by step.

---

class: center, middle

# As you follow the instructions, remember the advice from the textbook that keyboard precision is very, very important when working with the Terminal. If you aren't paying very close attention to what you're supposed to type and what you've actually typed in the Terminal, you're going to run into instances where your commands plain don't work.

class: center, middle

# Just like any other activity, I'm happy to help you troubleshoot, but if you're having trouble, please make sure to check for typos first!

---

class: center, middle

# You are going to demonstrate your completion of this application activity by submitting four specific screenshots.

Brianna Beaumont

# "Viewers of the new box office blockbuster "“Matrix Reloaded”" should not be tempted to emulate the realistic depiction of computer hacking, warns the British Computer Society (BCS)."

# "They probably show more unrealistic depictions of the command line because the command line itself looks very bland and not colorful at all so they tweak it to make it look cooler and more high tech."

Jeremy Brentzel

# "I think it purely comes down to the fact that the animations look more interesting to the eye and will be more memorable than the regular command line. "

# "I believe this just gives the movie and audience a more intense scene, you get to see the actor struggle with the code and finally accomplish what they are doing."
