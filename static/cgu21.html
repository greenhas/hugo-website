# online presence, naming, and legitimacy

This is a talk about online presence, naming, and legitimacy. The connection between these last two is hardly new,

# "We believe that what is really at play in the debate over the use of 'Mormon' is legitimacy."

Cragun, R. T., &amp; Nielsen, M. (2009). Fighting over 'Mormon': Media coverage of the FLDS and LDS churches. *Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought*, *42*, 1. 

???

An excellent 2009 article by Cragun and Nielsen makes the argument for how naming is intertwined with legitimacy in the Smith-Rigdon religious movement (or at least in disputes between mainstream and fundamentalist Mormons). What I'd like to add is that legitimacy-driven shifts in naming are also connected to changes in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints's online presence.

For example, in October 1996, the Church is concerned about its legitimacy as a Christian entity, and it [announces a new logo](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1996/10/news-of-the-church/new-church-logo-announced?lang=eng), that puts the name of Jesus Christ front and center. 

One month later, in **November** 1996...

...the Wayback Machine operated by the Internet Archive captures an under-construction lds.org for the first time. A concern about legitimacy led to a shift in naming, and the shift in naming occurred at the same time as a shift in online presence.

(Note a [similar example](https://web.archive.org/web/20010422055040/http://cofchrist.org:80/news/q_and_a-churchname.asp) from the RLDS to CofC name change a few years later)

In 2001, we see a similar pattern. The Salt Lake Winter Olympics are fast approaching, the Church really starts to [distance itself from the term "Mormon Church"](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/19/us/adapting-mormon-to-emphasize-christianity.html), but, bowing to the inevitable, it...

... a central piece of the Church's "I'm a Mormon" campaign, this is part of a leaning into the word "Mormon" that's meant to suggest that the fundamentalist Mormons Americans are seeing on the news and on Big Love are not legitimately Mormons—this is actually the dispute that Cragun and Nielsen were writing about.

I want to do more than to suggest that online presence is also connected to naming and legitimacy, though. The changes happening in August 2018 demonstrate that changes in the online sphere **complicate** these concerns about naming and, especially, legitimacy.

We can get a sense of this from the last phrase in the Church's official announcement, which reads...

???

There's a hint here that the Church knows that they needs to change their online presence, but they didn't work that out before making the big announcement, so they don't yet know how they're going to make those changes.

It's unsurprising that the Church will want to move away from its long-held domain name, lds.org, because it no longer sees acronyms as legitimate.

???

It's also unsurprising that lds.org eventually turned into churchofjesuschrist.org, because Latter-day Saint leaders have been promoting "The Church of Jesus Christ" since at least 2001. 

However, the sociotechnical systems that make up the internet don't measure the legitimacy of names in terms of theological or historical claims, they measure the legitimacy of names in terms of markets and ownerships—a domain name is a piece of property that has one legitimate owner who maintains legitimate control over that name.

And in August 2018, another church already owns churchofjesuschrist.org. They've actually owned it since 1999, though I'm going to take you to 2001, when the website identifies its owners as...

the Independence, Missouri based "Church of Jesus Christ in Zion," which, interestingly, broadcasts its services online. This brief description suggests some other ways that questions of legitimacy are about to get complicated: Independence is a site of contested legitimacy within the Smith-Rigdon religious movement (that is, who is the legitimate heir to Joseph Smith, Jr.?), and broadcasting worship services online in 2001 suggests some familiarity with technical logics of legitimacy, both of which are distinct from (and will therefore complicate) the Christian legitimacy that Salt Lake is trying to establish on the internet.

To return to the Church of Jesus Christ in Zion, we have to talk about its leader: [Roger Billings](https://www.deseret.com/2004/1/3/19804670/publicity-follows-billings-brother), who lived in Utah until the 1980s, when after a dispute with the Utah-based tech company Novell and leaving the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, moves to Independence, allegedly to lead a polygamist Mormon offshoot denomination. 

Billings also has a few companies going in Independence and Kansas City, including a online learning platform that's gets some extra traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. With that extra traffic comes some [extra scrutiny](https://www.edweek.org/technology/complaints-over-offensive-content-lead-schools-to-drop-online-learning-provider/2020/08), not only because of sexist and racist content that's included in these online lessons but also because of allegations of abusive behavior in the Church of Jesus Christ in Zion, including unpaid labor for ventures like this online learning platform.

Billings responds to some of these critiques with [suggestions](https://www.khon2.com/always-investigating/acellus-online-content-flagged-as-petitions-ask-doe-to-cut-or-keep-it/) that it's actually a smear campaign originating in Salt Lake because of his departure from the Church 35 years earlier, so he obviously doesn't have warm feelings toward the Latter-day Saint leadership, but in August 2018, when the Church is looking at ditching lds.org,

We can see here that Billings's church has ownership of this domain at least through January 4th, 2020. That means that they have near-total control over the domain and will until they sell it, they let their ownership expire without renewing it, or they get it taken away from them in court, which is possible but not likely.

...I have a few questions.

Billings likely doesn't see the Latter-day Saint leadership as legitimate, is technically inclined, and has clear control over churchofjesuschrist.org, which could be a recipe for holding onto it out of spite.

On the other hand, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is rather large and famously wealthy, and Billings obviously eventually consented.

So, what convinced Billings? What did those negotiations look like? How much money was on the table? How did the Church feel about presumably conducting a high-value transaction with a controversial group of fundamentalist Mormons?

I can't answer this last question in detail, but I will note that in the past few months,

The Internet Archive's history of churchofjesuschrist.org prior to March 2019 has been erased, conveniently omitting the history of this domain name prior to its use by the LDS Church. When I asked the Wayback Machine if Salt Lake was behind thus, I got the response that they couldn't possibly comment on any particular website, but just so I was aware, "archives can be excluded from the Wayback Machine at the request of a rights holder."

So, not a firm answer, but I'd guess that the Church isn't eager to advertise this transaction. 

If that's the case, why didn't the Church try something else. For example,

# online presence, naming, and legitimacy

???

The Church's changing of its domain name is a natural step in its emphasis on its full name, which is a response to concerns about its Christian legitimacy. However, in order to change that domain name, it had to wrestle with two other kinds of legitimacy, because the legitimate owners of the domain names it wanted were other claimants to legitimacy as heirs to Joseph Smith's 1830 Church of Christ.

The changes to the Church's social media presence over the past two years also illustrate these intersections and tensions. If you visit churchofjesuschrist.org today, you'll find an explanation that...

27 Facebook pages or groups associated with Church institutions, but in April 2021, the equivalent page on churchofjesuschrist.org only lists 4 pages or groups.

Its description of the Church's Facebook presence hasn't substantively changed since 2018, so it continues to list outdated pages, which by the way are still in English. To be fair, the Church has other elements to its Francophone online presence, but they have their own problems, and English has pretty clearly taken the first priority here. 

That said, I'll admit that French isn't the best language to use for a test case. 

Spanish is almost certainly the second linguistic priority of the Church, and we know the Church is thinking about its Spanish language online presence thanks to a September 2020 news release that explains...

# "its new Spanish-language news page... which consolidates the global faith’s 18 Newsrooms from Latin America"

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (2020, September 8). *Eighteen Spanish-language global newsroom sites consolidate into one* [News release]. https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/spanish-language-global-newsroom

that 18 previously distinct Hispanophone websites are being consolidated into one.

Note the presence of the word consolidated again. Earlier, when we saw the word consolidated, the rationale was...

that this was about the shift in naming, but the fact that country newsrooms are also being consolidated suggests to me that there are some other concerns at play here. In fact, in this same news release, Apostle Ronald Rasband is quoted as saying that

So it seems to me that the Church is taking advantage of changes to its online presence it already has to make in order to also rethink more broadly how it does the internet. To be frank, this reminds me of a smaller, online version of the mid 20th century Latter-day Saint correlation movement intended to

# "...bring under centralized control... various semi-autonomous auxiliaries and church programs”

This parallel is interesting because of the way that the mid 20th century correlation was so intertwined with questions of legitimacy: What are legitimate practices within the Church, who are the legitimate authorities to define those practices? 

I don't want to overstate the connection here, but I can't think of many better contexts than the internet for the Church to be wrestling with the 21st century versions of the questions that guided correlation, and I think these changes to the Church's social media presence reflect that. With that in mind, let's return to Twitter,

# 16 accounts  ➡️ 5 accounts

Like Facebook, there's a reduction of the number of official Church accounts on Twitter, but what's more interesting is the way that Twitter in particular strains at legitimacy as the Church wants to define it. 

For example, Twitter is famously known for its text constraints, which creates an issue for a Church that isn't willing to use abbreviation and acronyms...

So, in March 2019, the Church stops using its @LDSchurch account and starts using @ChurchNewsroom, which was previously limited to news releases. 

ChurchNewsroom has the advantage of avoiding acronyms, but it still isn't ideal. For example, because it's not all that distinctive, people continue to use the old account name to mention the Church in their tweets.

So in January 2020, there's a second change, to @Ch_JesusChrist, which is a bit more distinctive, but still clearly an imperfect compromise between the Church's concerns about Christian legitimacy and the clever brevity that lends legitimacy on Twitter.

Plus, CH is also the official country code for Switzerland, which led to smart aleck responses like...

Smart aleck responses, though, are what you should expect to find on Mormon Twitter. As I've written before, Mormon Twitter participants

#"present Mormon identities and approach Mormon practice in ways other than those that are typically seen (or approved of) in formal Church settings"

Greenhalgh, S. P., Staudt Willet, B. K., &amp; Koehler, M. J. (2019). Approaches to Mormon identity and practice in the #ldsconf Twitter hashtag. *Journal of Media and Religion*, *18*, 122-133. https://doi.org/10.1080/15348423.2019.1696121

Mormon Twitter's approach to legitimacy is much more bottom up than the official top down administration of the Church, and the last thing I'd like to discuss about social media presence connects specifically with that.

# “#ldsconf Getting ready for first session of conference”

# “@[twitter_user] trying to popularize #ldsconf - spread the word”

???

On October 4, 2008, a private individual created the #ldsconf Twitter hashtag for livetweeting the Latter-day Saint General Conference. 

Livetweeting is an activity where a group of people use Twitter to respond to and comment on a live activity

a hashtag is a key word or phrase that can organize all tweets associated with a topic or event, and over the next few years, #ldsconf became a grassroots way for Mormon Twitter to watch and talk about General Conference together.

In April 2013, the Church lends its official blessing to this grassroots effort, but beginning with the October 2018 General Conference, the Church began promoting #generalconference instead, because "LDS" is no longer acceptable.

This also gets some pushback,
