# online presence, naming, and legitimacy

???

Over the past 25 years, these three things have been tied together in the context of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

For example, in October 1996, the Church is concerned about its legitimacy as a Christian entity, and it [announces a new logo](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1996/10/news-of-the-church/new-church-logo-announced?lang=eng), that puts the name of Jesus Christ front and center. 

One month later, in **November** 1996...

...the Wayback Machine operated by the Internet Archive captures an under-construction lds.org for the first time. A concern about legitimacy led to a shift in naming, and the shift in naming occurred at the same time as a shift in online presence.

(Note a [similar example](https://web.archive.org/web/20010422055040/http://cofchrist.org:80/news/q_and_a-churchname.asp) from the RLDS to CofC name change a few years later)

In 2001, we see a similar pattern. The Salt Lake Winter Olympics are fast approaching, the Church really starts to [distance itself from the term "Mormon Church"](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/19/us/adapting-mormon-to-emphasize-christianity.html), but, bowing to the inevitable, it...

... purchases mormon.org from a private-but-sympathetic individual and turns it into an official website. 

A few years later, in 2008, Texas law enforcement has just raided a fundamentalist compound, so the Church is asking the media to only use the word "Mormon" to refer to them. This begins a somewhat surprising about-face on the part of the Latter-day Saint leadership, who start leaning into the name Mormon. Correspondingly...

... a central piece of the Church's "I'm a Mormon" campaign. It's a different approach to online presence based on a different approach to naming based on different concerns about legitimacy.

August 2018, though, is a different beast. Naming, legitmacy, and online presence are still intertwined, but there's more going on this time around. We can get a sense of this from the last phrase in the Church's official announcement, which reads...

???

There's a hint here that the Church knows that they needs to change their online presence, but they don't yet know how. There are big changes that need to happen, and on a broader scope than the Church has ever been working with before.

Let's start by going back to lds.org, which the Church has operated since 1996. "LDS" is no longer on the table because it poses a threat to the Church's legitimacy as the restored Church of Jesus Christ.

Since at least 2001, Latter-day Saint leaders have been promoting "The Church of Jesus Christ" as an acceptable abbreviation, so it's no surprise that lds.org eventually turned into churchofjesuschrist.org. The way that it got there, though, is surprisingly dramatic. In August 2018, someone else owns churchofjesuschrist.org. They've actually owned it since...

...a month, things start to get really interesting. 

First, hello there, Independence, Missouri! Things just potentially got a lot more dramatic.

Second, who is offering video feeds of worship services in 1999? In 2021, this isn't unheard of in a Latter-day Saint context, and it's arguably mainstream in a Community of Christ context, but in 1999? This speaks to some technical acumen.

Skipping forward to 2001 gives us enough pieces to put together the puzzle. Still offering online worship services, still based in Independence, but we've got an updated name here: the Church of Jesus Christ in Zion.

No one knows much about The Church of Jesus Christ in Zion, but there are a few things we do know. It's alleged to be a fundamentalist Mormon denomination (and fundamentalist in the polygamous sense) [led by a man named Roger Billings](https://www.deseret.com/2004/1/3/19804670/publicity-follows-billings-brother). It's an obscure denomination, but it has attracted controversy, with some [recent journalism](https://onezero.medium.com/a-major-online-learning-platform-was-created-by-a-subterranean-religious-cult-whose-leader-has-cec99e7adcaf) accusing the Church of Jesus Christ in Zion of physical, mental, and sexual violence under Billings's leadership. 

Billings is not only a religious leader but also technically inclined, hence the late 90s worship broadcasts; in the 1980s, he accused Novell of stealing some of his ideas, and in the 2020s, he's actually operating a distance learning platform that's getting some extra traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. With that extra traffic comes some [extra scrutiny](https://www.edweek.org/technology/complaints-over-offensive-content-lead-schools-to-drop-online-learning-provider/2020/08)  because of sexist and racist content that's being delivered to students. 

Billings responds to some of these critiques with [suggestions](https://www.khon2.com/always-investigating/acellus-online-content-flagged-as-petitions-ask-doe-to-cut-or-keep-it/) that it's actually a smear campaign originating in Salt Lake because of his departure from the church 35 years earlier, so he obviously doesn't have warm feelings toward the Latter-day Saint leadership.

Let's rewind, though, to

We can see here that Billings's church has ownership of this domain at least through January 4th, 2020. That means that they have near-total control over the domain and will until they sell it, they let their ownership expire without renewing it, or they get it taken away from them in court, which is possible but not likely.

... churchofjesuschrist.org is now the property of Intellectual Reserve, the entity owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that manages its intellectual property.

So, over this two month span, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has seemingly negotiated the purchase of churchofjesuschrist.org from the Church of Jesus Christ in Zion, and in March of 2019, five months later, it will eventually replace lds.org with this new acquisition.

I don't know about you, but I have so many questions. 

As a fundamentalist Mormon, Billings almost certainly doesn't believe in the legitimacy of the LDS Church, he's technically inclined, and he has absolute and legitimate control over a domain name that the LDS Church is interested in. It wouldn't be that expensive to renew that domain name forever to stick it to the Latter-day Saint leadership. 

On the other hand, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is rather large and famously wealthy. 

So, what I want to know is this: How did that domain name change hands? What did the negotiations look like? How much money do you think was on the table? 

How did the Church feel about sending a not insubstantial amount of money to an obscure but controversial, polygamous offshoot denomination (given that that's the most likely explanation for what's happened here).

I can't answer this in detail, but I will note that several months ago, when I began working on this project, the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine had captures of churchofjesuschrist.org going all the way back

You will notice that its history only goes back to March 2019, conveniently omitting the history of this domain name prior to its use by the LDS Church. 

When I discovered this, I reached out to the Wayback Machine to ask if Salt Lake had asked them to erase some internet history. I eventually got a response that they couldn't possibly comment on any particular website, but just so I was aware, "archives can be excluded from the Wayback Machine at the request of a rights holder."

So, not a firm answer, but I'd guess that the Church isn't proud of their domain name's association with the Church of Jesus Christ in Zion. 

If that's the case, why didn't the Church try something else. For example,

# online presence, naming, and legitimacy

???

The Church's changing of its domain name is a natural step in its emphasis on its full name, which is a response to concerns about its Christian legitimacy, but acting on those concerns in the online sphere also raises 21st century questions about technical logics of legitimacy and revives 19th and 20th century disputes over the legitimate heir to Joseph Smith, Jr.

The changes to the Church's social media presence over the past two years also illustrate these intersections and tensions. If you visit churchofjesuschrist.org today, you'll find an explanation that...

This consolidation effort is pretty considerable; for example, in August 2018, the English version of [lds.org lists](http://web.archive.org/web/20180815115856if_/https://www.lds.org/media-library/social?lang=eng)...

# 27 pages/groups  ➡️ 4 pages/groups

27 Facebook pages or groups associated with Church institutions, but in April 2021, the equivalent page on churchofjesuschrist.org only lists 4 pages or groups. Now, many of these pages are actually still active, they've just been taken off the official list, but there's no denying that there was some trimming going on.

This is a good time to mention that everything I've been talking about gets a lot messier outside of the English language.

To take, for example, my beloved French, if you visit the French language version of churchofjesuschrist.org

Its description of the Church's Facebook presence hasn't substantively changed since 2018, so it continues to list outdated pages, which by the way are still in English. The Church has other elements to its Francophone online presence, but they have their own problems, and English has pretty clearly taken the first priority here. 

That said, I'll admit that French isn't the best language to use for a test case. 

Spanish is almost certainly the second linguistic priority of the Church, and we know the Church is working on its Spanish language online presence thanks to a September 2020 news release that explains...

that 18 previously distinct Hispanophone websites are being consolidated into one.

Note the presence of the word consolidated again. Earlier, when we saw the word consolidated, the rationale was...

???

that this was about the shift in naming, but the fact that country newsrooms are also being consolidated suggests to me that there are some other concerns at play here. In fact, in this same news release, Apostle Ronald Rasband is quoted as saying that

So it seems to me that the Church is taking advantage of changes it already has to make in order to also rethink more broadly how it does the internet. To be honest, this reminds me of a smaller, online version of the mid 20th century Latter-day Saint correlation movement intended to

???

This parallel is interesting because of the way that correlation is so intertwined with questions of legitimacy: What are legitimate practices within the Church, who are the legitimate authorities to define those practices? 

I don't want to overstate the connection here, but I can't think of any better context but the internet for the Church to be wrestling with the 21st century versions of the questions that guided correlation, and I think these changes to the Church's social media presence reflect that. Let's look in particular at Twitter,

# 16 accounts  ➡️ 5 accounts

???

Like Facebook, there's a reduction of the number of official Church accounts on Twitter, but what's more interesting is the way that Twitter in particular strains at legitimacy as the Church wants to define it. 

For example, Twitter is famously known for its text constraints, which creates an issue for a Church that isn't willing to use the frankly perfect in Twitter terms @LDSChurch for a screenname anymore.

So, on March 5th, 2019, at the same time the Church rolls out a new website, it announces that it's going to stop using @LDSchurch and start using @ChurchNewsroom, which was previously an independent account for the English-language newsroom site, as its official web presence. The Church is smart and holds onto the @LDSchurch account so that no one else can claim it, but they stop posting from it and eventually turn the account private. 

ChurchNewsroom has the advantage of avoiding acronyms, but it still isn't ideal, though, because it's not really distinctive, and so people continue to use the old account name to refer to the Church in their tweets.

So in January 2020, there's a second change, to @Ch_JesusChrist, which is a bit more distinctive. At this point, it's the now-old ChurchNewsroom account that gets powered down. 

This username is probably the best compromise between legitimacy as conceived of by the  Latter-day Saint leadership and legitimacy as it plays out on Twitter, but it's clearly caught in a difficult place between the two. To the detriment of Latter-day Saint views of legitimacy, Twitter's character limits won't allow the whole name of the Church or even the accepted abbreviated name to fit within a username. And if legitimacy on Twitter is driven in part by clever uses of brevity, this just doesn't work quite as well as LDSChurch did. 

Plus, CH is also the official country code for Switzerland, which led to smart aleck responses like this one:

this one about the account belonging to Swiss Jesus. 

Smart aleck responses, though, are what you should expect to find on Mormon Twitter. As I've written before, Mormon Twitter participants

???

In other words, legitimacy on Mormon Twitter is different than it is in a Latter-day Saint chapel, and not just because of technical constraints. Mormon Twitter is much more bottom up than the official top down administration of the Church, and the last thing I'd like to discuss about the Church's changing its social media presence connects specifically with that.

# “#ldsconf Getting ready for first session of conference”

# “@[twitter_user] trying to popularize #ldsconf - spread the word”

???

On October 4, 2008, a private individual created the #ldsconf Twitter hashtag for livetweeting the Latter-day Saint General Conference. Livetweeting is an activity where a group of people use Twitter to respond to and comment on a live activity; a hashtag is a key word or phrase that can organize all tweets associated with a topic or event, so over the next few years, #ldsconf became a grassroots way for Mormon Twitter to watch and talk about General Conference together.

In fact, beginning in April 2013, the Church even adopted the hashtag and turned this grassroots effort into part of its official social media presence. Come August 2018, though, and the "LDS" in "LDSConf" was no longer acceptable, so beginning with the October 2018 General Conference, the Church began promoting #generalconference instead.

This also got some pushback.

Sometimes that pushback was based on that same tension between Twitter legitimacy and Latter-day Saint legitimacy, but there was also the sense that the Church had responded to a grassroots efforts by endorsing it but then taking it over and telling people they couldn't use it anymore. In response, you get
