    <p style="text-align:left">My name is Spencer Greenhalgh, and I am an assistant professor of <a href="http://ci.uky.edu/sis/ict" target="_blank">Information Communication Technology</a> in the <a href="http://ci.uky.edu/sis/" target="_blank">School of Information Science</a> and Associate Graduate Faculty in the <a href="http://ci.uky.edu/" target="_blank">College of Communication and Information</a> at the University of Kentucky. My background is in education—I earned a <a href="http://french.byu.edu/" target="_blank">BA in French Teaching from Brigham Young University</a> and a <a href="http://edutech.educ.msu.edu/" target="_blank">PhD in Educational Psychology and Educational Technology from Michigan State University</a> before joining the faculty at UK.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left">I focus my research on the affordances and implications of information communication technologies for teaching, learning, and other meaningful practices. Much of this research involves collection of data from digital platforms, often through automated means such as web scraping or application programming interfaces. In analyzing data, I combine computational methods developed in data science with the human-driven approaches valued in qualitative research. Whatever methods I use, I am firmly committed to an interpretative, person- and meaning-focused research paradigm.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left">The majority of my research reflects my background in education. For example, I have widely published on teachers' use of Twitter for professional learning and am also exploring other education-related platforms such as ClassDojo and TeachersPayTeachers. I also publish on methodological and ethical considerations for digital research in the field of educational technology. In conjunction with this research, I am active in the <a href="https://aect.org/">Association for Educational Technology</a>—particularly the Research and Theory Division.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:left">Because digital methods are useful in a number of fields, I am increasingly active in the field of Mormon/Restoration studies. In particular, I have published about—and continue to research— "Mormon Twitter," but I am also interested in other ways that information communication technologies intersect with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other Restoration traditions. I currently serve as webmaster and a steering committee member for the <a href="https://www.globalmormonstudies.org/">Global Mormon Studies network</a>.</p>
